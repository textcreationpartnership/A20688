            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I will adde one other particular: When men ſhall be ſo <hi>impiouſly preſumptuous,</hi> as to break into the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and peremptorily to pronounce of his unſcrutable judgements, (as if they had beene his counſellors) and to caſt the cauſes of the preſent plague, and all the evills that have lately threatned or befallen us, upon <hi>thoſe men,</hi> to whom, next under God, we owe, and in duty ought to acknowledge, our preſervation hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and that the plague and other evils have no more raged amongſt us; yea and upon thoſe <hi>meanes,</hi> which God hath ſanctified for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of his judgements. It is high time then to ſpeake, leſt ſilence ſhould be interpreted a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of guilt, and inability to wipe off ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and malicious ſlanders. And herein, I have for my warrant, the <hi>authority</hi> of the ſame <hi>Father,</hi> who having, upon the grounds before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, long held his peace, and with patience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the rage of his adverſaries, at length hee thus breaks forth: <hi>Seeing thou</hi> [Demetrianus] <note place="margin">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10652:9"/> and contumelies. Yet withall I know and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the iniquity of the times is not ſuch, but that truth and a good cauſe may yet finde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall judges, who following the precept of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Iudge not according to appearance,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 14.</note>

And others there are (no doubt) who, though led away, for the preſent, with the example of the multiutde, and enſnared by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they have unwarily drunk in, of the worth of the broachers of error, yet will notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be patient of better information, and upon due conſideration be ready to expreſſe their love to truth and peace. To theſe ſorts of men princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally I addreſſe my ſelfe in this diſcourſe, whom I ſhall deſire not to expect that <hi>verboſity,</hi> much leſſe that <hi>virulency</hi> &amp; <hi>opprobrious language</hi> which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <p>The Author then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>H. Burton,</hi> had his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at firſt, for ſome ſhort time, in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10652:12"/> in the ſame place as before when he was Prince of Wales. And he thinking the time now come wherein hee might come even with thoſe whom he conceived to be his adverſaries and hinderers of that his intruſion into the Cloſet, and of his hoped voyage into Spaine (and ſo of his deſired preferment) hee behaved himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that His Majeſty diſmiſſed him the Court and his ſervice: whence being caſhier'd, and all his hopes of preferment daſht, he betakes himſelfe to the <hi>people,</hi> as more patient of his criminations, and more apt to ſide with him, againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and having, by the help of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, advanced, from the hatred of ſome Biſhops perſons, to a totall diſlike of their order, and of all their proceedings; hee made their actions his continuall theme, and his Sermons <note place="margin">See his Plea to an Appeale.</note> and writings ſo many ſatyres, and bitter inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, accuſing them of Arminianiſme, Popery, <note place="margin">Seven vials &amp;c.</note> and whatſoever might make them odious, and himſelfe gracious with his <hi>new-maſters,</hi> the People, and proceeding in this courſe with ſtrange violence, (the State and Church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as I conceive, bearing the more with him, in regard of his diſcontent for the loſſe of his hopes at Court) hee ſent forth a booke called <hi>A Divine Tragedy lately acted, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he hath <note place="margin">See p 61.</note> in a ſtrangely preſumptuous and daring manner perckt up into Gods throne, and taken upon him to read the darke and dimme characters of the cauſes of his inſcrutable judgements: and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted many late accidents that have happened, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10652:12"/> make them ſpeake Gods indignation againſt ſuch as have uſed the liberty granted by His Majeſties late <hi>Declaration for ſports upon the Sundayes and Holy-dayes:</hi> of which accidents, there are ſome which fayle in the truth of ſtory; others, that are ſo common and ordinary, that it is ridiculous to reckon the for memorable examples of Gods judgments: others that though they may well be accounted ſuch, yet have other cauſes of them, that may with more probability bee aſſigned, than that for which he brings them: yea, there is not one of them that ſo clearely ſpeakes that which hee pretends, that any man (without the juſt imputation of impious raſhneſs) can ſay that they were inflicted for that cauſe onely or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally: and (which is yet more) granting that they were all true, and ſo remarkable as hee makes them, and that they did (in as plaine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as is poſſible for them) ſpeake Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the profanation of the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, yet will it not follow, that God did thereby confirme the <hi>Sunday-Sabbatarian</hi> doctrine, and condemne the contrary, and expreſs, from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his diſallowance of his Majeſties Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the lawfull making uſe of that liberty which is there permitted. For, without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether the obſervation of the Lords-day ſtand by vertue of Gods <hi>immediate precept,</hi> in the <hi>fourth Commandement,</hi> or otherwiſe; or onely by <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of that day muſt needs bee a grievous ſinne and powerfull attractive of <hi>Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:10652:13"/> ſeeing it is acknowledged by all, that, in the prophanation of that day, both <hi>Gods precept</hi> (ſo farre as it is moral in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is violated, and the <hi>authority</hi> which God hath commanded all Chriſtians to obey, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: yea and the publick worſhip of God, without which there can bee no true religion, neglected, vilified and overthrowne. But his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ayme in all this was, by this means, to ſtirre up, againſt the Prelacy, the envy and hatred of the people, who are eaſily wrought upon by the noyſe of judgements, and more taken with a bold aſſertion of what neither they, nor he that ſpeakes it, are able to diſcerne the truth of, than by the power of ſolid reaſon, or the plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of naked truth. At laſt he preached theſe ſermons which wee have before us, in which hee ſhewed that extremity of virulency, as the like I thinke hath not beene heard to be delivered out of the Pulpit, againſt the perſons of ſome <hi>Prelates</hi> and their <hi>actions,</hi> againſt the <hi>High Commiſsion Court,</hi> the moſt reverend Father in God the L. <hi>Arch-biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> yea, he hath not ſpared the <hi>Royall Perſon</hi> of his <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> whoſe piety and religious government he hath moſt unchriſtianly and undutifully (to ſay no worſe) endeavoured to blaſt, by moſt odious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations and calumnies. And having thus ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe things in the Pulpit, they were ſent abroad (by way of an abſtract or Epitome) in a libell intituled <hi>Newes from Ipſwich:</hi> for any man that compares that <hi>libell</hi> with his Sermons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10652:13"/> ſhall finde, that in both the materials are the ſame; and if both (in their formes) were not his, it muſt needs bee that hee and the author of that libell had conſulted together, and conferred notes; or perhaps they were ſet out by ſome zelote which gathered notes from his Sermons. And being queſtioned in the <hi>High Commiſsion</hi> for the things by him delivered in theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> he <hi>Appealed</hi> from them to His <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> and printed <hi>his Appeale and an Apology for</hi> it, and two <hi>Epiſtles</hi> inſcribed, one to the <hi>true-hearted Nobility,</hi> and another to the <hi>reverend Iudges,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Sermons, and dedicated both by two ſeverall Epiſtles to His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>For the man, Charity commands me to pity him, but I can ſee no foundation for charity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; for when I doe but read him in this, and ſee to what an height of deſperate boldneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, fomented by popularity, hath brought him, I can deviſe no better Apology, nor other way to free him from the juſt imputation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered malice, and trayterous intention, than to ſay that diſcontent at once hath crackt his braine and his conſcience. Nor can I give a better character of him, than that which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> long <note place="margin">

That he was by divine providence directed to that text,</hi> Prov. 24. 21, 22. <hi>That the doctrines of it were neceſſary for the times, ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the day on which they were preached, and ſo, like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> For my part, I ſhall eaſily grant him that the text is <hi>for God and the King,</hi> and ſerves to teach men obedience to both; but how the <hi>Sermons</hi> were ſuited to the <hi>text,</hi> let wiſe men judge. I ſhall alſo grant, that the <hi>text</hi> was neceſſary for the times, and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough for the day too; but as by him perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, made an incentive to animate ill-affected hearts to <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>defection</hi> from the due <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> both of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> So that hee
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10652:16"/> might rather have likened them to the <hi>Apples of Sodome,</hi> which are beautifull in ſhew, but containe nothing but ſulphureous duſt and rottenneſſe. And how he ſaith he was directed to it by <hi>divine providence,</hi> I know not; one thing I know, that the providence of God is as well in permitting <hi>evill,</hi> as in effecting of <hi>good,</hi> and ſo <hi>Gods providence</hi> might well be ſaid to ſuffer him to fall upon, or to point him out that text to abuſe and wreſt, that thereby he might fill up the meaſure of his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fall into the hands of juſtice. But I rather think, under the name of <hi>Divine providence</hi> hee aymes at an extraordinary <hi>calling</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> from the ſpirit of God, which ſuch as he uſe to pretend, for countenance to their <hi>exorbitancies;</hi> or as in his Epiſtle to the <hi>true-hearted Nobility, that Chriſt hath called him.</hi> If he meane thus for what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> upon the <hi>text,</hi> I pitty his ſeduced fancy: for no honeſt or wiſe-hearted Chriſtian can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thoſe bitter raylings, ſlanders, lyes, ſurmiſes, and ſeditious inſtigations, &amp;c. which (for the moſt part) are the <hi>matter</hi> of his <hi>Sermons,</hi> can proceed from the motion of any other <hi>ſpirit,</hi> than that <hi>which now worketh in the hearts of the Children</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of diſobedience. However,</hi> (if you will beleeve him) <hi>they had the generall good acceptation with the people, whoſe hearts were much affected by them:</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, their <hi>itching eares</hi> were well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with hearing of thoſe that are in authority boldly taxed, and their faults (as they conceive them) ripped up, which all, that know their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, know to bee a moſt delightfull ſubject to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10652:16"/> treat upon. And no queſtion, this was a <hi>ſtrong motive</hi> to him for the <hi>publiſhing of them in print;</hi> and more prevalent than that of his <hi>ſuperiours</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a <hi>Copie</hi> of them. If ſuperiours command <note place="margin">Appeal ep. 15.</note> him to bring in a Copy, <hi>he conceives he is not bound to doe it, nor they to require it, by the law either of God or man:</hi> but the <hi>peoples acceptation</hi> and <hi>liking,</hi> is a ſufficient motive to <hi>print</hi> them. It ſeemes his ayme in his Sermons was the ſame which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et had in making his comedyes, <hi>To pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Populo ut place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent &amp;c.</note> and that they were only calculated for the Meridian of their liking, whom if they pleaſed, no matter what others, though never ſo high in place or authority, thought of them.</p>
               <p>I here paſſe by the <hi>ſtory</hi> which he tels His moſt excellent Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, which we have more at large elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as likewiſe his reaſons of his preſenting his Majeſtie with them, and his refreſhing his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with his ſolemne and ſacred proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reſerving them to a fitter place.

Only for a cloſe to it, I note that he ſeemes here more reſolute, than in his Epiſtle before his Appeale: for there he ſhewes his feare of being apprehended and brought into the <hi>High Commiſsion,</hi> which he calls the <hi>lions den:</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes an argument of <hi>a malefactor, who are glad to keep cloſe and avoid appearance.</hi> But <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (as the ſame Author notes) <hi>were never aſhamed, never repented, but that they were not brought to profeſsion ſooner.</hi> So that his reſolution here <hi>for priſon or not priſon,</hi> is the better temper, and more like the <hi>ancient martyrs,</hi> were but his <hi>cauſe</hi> like theirs, <hi>which</hi> (as <hi>St. Auſtine</hi> long ſince obſerved) <hi>and not the ſuffering, is that which makes true Martyrs: otherwiſe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more wicked or more perverſe, than for men not to know how to be aſhamed of their puniſhment, but</hi>

                     <hi>Of the ſuppoſed Innovations in Doctrine. Of King</hi> James <hi>his Order to the Vniverſities for reading the Fathers: done long ſince: unjuſtly charged upon the preſent Biſhops.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <q>FIrſt, <hi>ſaith he, they</hi> (the Prelats) <hi>have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to bring in a change of Doctrine, as appeareth by theſe inſtances.</hi> 1. <hi>By procuring an Order from King</hi> James <hi>of famous memory to the Vniverſities, that young ſtudents ſhould not read our Moderne learned Writers, as</hi> Calvin, Beza, <hi>and others of the reformed Churches but the Fathers and Schoolemen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This firſt crimination is farre fetcht, being (if I miſtake not) a thing acted above twenty yeeres agoe; ſo that it ſeemes hee meanes to take him compaſſe enough, the times preſent not affording him ſufficient ſtore; and, if hee had gone backe but twice as many more, hee might have found the reading of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> accounted as great an Innovation, as now he holds the debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of men from reading of them; and that by thoſe that were as good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and as farre from <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10652:23"/>
               <p> But ſecondly, being ſo <hi>long agoe</hi> done, I cannot ſee how hee can lay it upon the <hi>preſent Prelates,</hi> eſpecially upon thoſe whom hee moſt ſtrives to make odious, none of them being Biſhops at that time. But, if they muſt inherit the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their Predeceſſors faults:</p>
               <p>In the third place, how doth it appeare that it was the Biſhops doing? Marry becauſe, <hi>King Iames approved and magnified thoſe Orthodox Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and gave the right hand of fellowſhip to thoſe reformed Churches which thoſe Authors had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or watered: calling that the Orthodox faith which thoſe Churches did profeſſe: and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar did commend</hi> Calvin <hi>as the moſt judicious and ſound expoſitor of Scripture: And therefore it were impious to imagine that King</hi> James <hi>ſhould doe any act in prejudice of</hi> Calvin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well; But might not that judicious King, or any man elſe approve the Authors in the general, and yet diſlike ſome things in them, for which hee might thinke them not ſo fit for young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Divinity to lay them for the foundation of their ſtudies? It is no prejudice to the beſt of them, nor indeed to any man, as being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmity of humane nature, to ſay that in ſome things they erred: Much leſſe can it wrong them to have the ancient Fathers (from whoſe torches, they lighted their candles) preferred as the more worthy: And it is one thing to give the right hand of fellowſhip to a particular Church, (which we willingly doe to all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches beyond the Seas) and another
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10652:24"/> to like and approve every Tenet that any man in that Church ſhall hold or deliver. I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> is not ſo uncharitable as to deny the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therane Churches the right hand of fellowſhip, and to exclude them from being a true Church; and yet I beleeve hee would bee loath to agree with them in all opinions which they maintaine; eſpecially if hee knew (for I have heard that, in place where, not many yeeres agoe, he bewrayed his ignorance, and was faine to be informed by a brother Miniſter then in preſence) that they held all thoſe Tenets about <hi>Predeſtination, Freewill,</hi> and <hi>falling from grace,</hi> which hee ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes in thoſe, whom hee termes <hi>Arminians.</hi> Neither can it be imagined that King <hi>Iames,</hi> when hee acknowledged <hi>Calvin</hi> (and therein did him but right) to bee a <hi>moſt judicious expoſitour of Scripture,</hi> ever intended to exempt him from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when it is moſt manifeſt that hee did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne many opinions of his; and that though he had been bred and brought up among thoſe who received their doctrine and diſcipline from <hi>Calvin,</hi> yet (as himſelfe profeſſed in the Conference at Hampton-Court) <hi>from the time that he was tenne yeeres old, hee ever diſliked their</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Confer. p. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>opinions, and that, though he lived among them, he was not of them:</hi> And therefore might, without croſſing his owne judgement, enjoyne young ſtudents rather to looke into the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with the judgement of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> than to take up opinions upon truſt of thoſe <hi>moderne Authors,</hi> who though (as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10652:24"/> he after addes) they were not without their <hi>Naevi</hi> or <hi>ſpots,</hi> yet no man (without betraying inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride and ignorance) will account their workes <hi>a dunghill,</hi> or <hi>heape of mud,</hi> where hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with much raking and prying a man may chance to light upon a Pearle, ſo as <hi>they that reade them muſt Margaritas è caeno legere, gather pearles out of the mud,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> is pleaſed to ſpeake. I am ſure other men (as ſound and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious as himſelfe every whit) have held it a point of wiſedome, to draw water as neere as they can from the well-head, rather than from lakes and ciſternes. And the truth is, that King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory (whether by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of the Biſhops or not, it matters not, for neither the Author, nor the procurers need bluſh for it) having taken ſome <hi>juſt diſtaſte</hi> at ſome <hi>novell points</hi> delivered by ſome <hi>young Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> which trenched upon his <hi>Regall power</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> and knowing from what pits that water was drawne, and that thoſe <hi>moderne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> mentioned, were ill affected to <hi>Monarchicall Government,</hi> and injurious to the juſt right of Kings, going hand in hand with the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>popularity:</hi> Did in his Princely wiſedome, for the preventing of ſo great a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as might enſue, if ſuch principles were drunk in at the firſt, by young and injudicious Novices, give charge to the Heads of the Univerſity of Cambridge (I am ſure, and whether of Oxford too, I know not) that they ſhould take order that young ſtudents ſhould bee well ſeaſoned at
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10652:25"/> the beginning, and well grounded in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Our owne Catechiſme, and the Articles and Doctrine of our Church, and that they ſhould not ground their ſtudies upon thoſe men, where they might with their firſt milke in Divinity ſucke in ſuch unſound opinions and dangerous to the State:</hi> But rather, that they would ſearch into <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and ſtudy the writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whoſe <hi>conſentient Doctrine</hi> is (without doubt) the beſt and ſoundeſt Divinity. And if Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> had taken this courſe in his ſtudies, hee had learned better <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Superiours,</hi> and beene leſſe troubleſome to himſelfe and others. This then is but a fetch, and brought in onely to increaſe the heape of <hi>odium</hi> upon the Biſhops, with thoſe <note place="margin">Pag. 114.</note> who judge of things not by weight or worth, but by noiſe and number: For there is no colour for that which he ſuggeſts, that it ſhould be <hi>done, the more eaſily to make way for the accompliſhing of their [the Prelats] plot, ſo long a hammering for the reinducing of Popery;</hi> ſeeing neither that which was done, nor the end for which it was done, have the leaſt affinity with Popery, but was intended for the oppoſing and preventing of that point of Popery or Jeſuitiſme, which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and armes the people againſt their Princes.</p>

               <p>For anſwere to theſe: I ſay for the firſt, That hee hath ſhamefully ſlandered the Univerſity: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Heads whereof are more judicious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, than to ſuffer any poſition which doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and in <hi>terminis</hi> croſſe the Articles of our

                  </hi> when the greateſt heat was ſtricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between us and <hi>Rome)</hi> have affirmed the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and his whole religion <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> and that ſome, exceeding the bounds of moderation in this point, have paſſed abroad, &amp; that with the licenſe of authority (wherein yet they are to be excuſed, in that they have beene ſo intolerably provoked by the odious criminations of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary) yet to them that calmely and ſeriouſly conſider it, it may not without good reaſon bee diſputed as doubtfull: whether the Pope, or any of them, in his perſon, or the Papall Hierarchy bee that great Antichriſt, which is ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. And which way ſoever it be determined, it makes not the religion any whit the better, nor frees the practiſes of the Popes and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from being juſtly accounted and ſtiled <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Shelfords</hi> ſecond Book, I have not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſeene it, and therefore will ſay nothing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, if hee ſeeme to ſet (as they thinke) too light by preaching and pulpits, hee doth (at the worſt) but pay them in their owne coine, who have magnified it to the vilifying and contempt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10652:34"/> of publick Prayer, the moſt ſacred and excellent part of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>Neither have I ſeene that other Booke, called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the <hi>Female glory,</hi> nor will I ſpend words, by way either of cenſure or defence of it, upon ſight onely of thoſe fragments which here hee preſents us with, as well knowing his art, and at what rate to value his credit in quotations. Yet in all thoſe panegyrick ſtraines of Rhetorick (for ſuch for the moſt part they ſeeme, rather than poſitiue aſſertions) he hath not deviated ſo much to the one extreme, as <hi>Mr. Burtons</hi> margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hath to the other, in ſcoffingly calling her, the New great Goddeſſe Diana. And if it bee true that hee hath not digreſſed in any particular <note place="margin">Lo here the new great god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> whom the whole Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian world worſhippeth. <hi>H.

For (it is well known) that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (whom he (as if hee had bid adieu to all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, yea and ſhame too) termes a <hi>tried Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of Rome, and ſo a devout votary to the Queene of heaven)</hi> hath approved himſelfe ſuch a <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> that they that have tried his ſtrength durſt never yet come to a ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>
               <p>Beſide, we have, elſewhere, other points of <note place="margin">Pag. 67.</note> Popiſh Doctrine, which, he ſaith, are preached, and printed of late: As <hi>Auricular Confeſsion, Prayer for the dead, and praying to Saints:</hi> Which, becauſe I finde onely mentioned by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proofe to evidence the truth of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10652:34"/> I might with one word reject, till hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Authors, which have ſo Preached and Printed, and what it was that they have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching thoſe points. But becauſe there are many that, by reaſon of their ignorance of the truth in theſe points, are apt to beleeve what he affirmes, and to entertaine a ſiniſter opinion of the Churches Doctrine in them; I will briefly adde ſome of them in this place.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>Confeſsion:</hi> It cannot bee denied, <note place="margin">Of Confeſſion</note> but that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did ever allow the <hi>private confeſsion</hi> of ſinnes to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> for <note place="margin">Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, Exhortation before the Communion.</note> the quieting of mens conſciences burdened with ſinne, and <hi>that they may receive ghoſtly counſell, advice and comfort, and the benefit of abſolution.</hi> This is the publike Order preſcribed in our Church. And it were very ſtrange, if our Church ordaining Prieſts, and giving them power of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and preſcribing the forme to bee uſed <note place="margin">Forme of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in the Viſitation of the ſick.</note> for the exerciſe of that power upon confeſſion, ſhould not alſo allow of ſuch <hi>private confeſsion.</hi> To <hi>adviſe</hi> then and <hi>urge</hi> the uſe and profit of <hi>private confeſsion</hi> to the Prieſt, is no <hi>Popiſh Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> but agreeable to the conſtant and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of this Church; and that which is requiſite for the due execution of that ancient power of the Keyes, which Chriſt beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Church: And if any ſhall call it, <hi>auricular,</hi> becauſe it is done in private, and in the <hi>eare of the Prieſt,</hi> I know not why hee ſhould therefore bee condemned of Popery. But if Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> by <hi>Auricular Confeſsion,</hi> meane that <hi>Sacramentall</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10652:35"/> 
                  <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> which the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to bee of <hi>abſolute neceſsity</hi> by Divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and that which exacts that (many times impoſſible) particular enumeration of every ſinne, and the ſpeciall circumſtances of every ſinne. This wee juſtly reject, as neither requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>God,</hi> nor ſo practiſed by the ancient <note place="margin">See Biſhop Uſhers anſwer to Ieſuites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And if Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> knowes any, that hath Preached or Printed ought in defence of this new pick-lock, and tyrannicall ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> hee may, if he pleaſe, (with the Churches good leave) terme them in that point, Popiſh Innovators.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond point: Simply to condemne <note place="margin">Of prayer for the dead.</note> all prayer for the Dead, is to runne counter to the conſtant practiſe of the ancient Church of Chriſt. <hi>Prayer for the dead, it cannot bee deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is ancient,</hi> ſaith the late learned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> That the ancient Church had <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations, Oblations,</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> for the dead, the teſtimonies of the <hi>Fathers, Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories,</hi> and ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> in which the formes of Prayers, uſed for that purpoſe, are <note place="margin">Cannon 55.</note> found, doe put out of all queſtion: and they that are acquainted with the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our owne Church, cannot but ſay this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath beene ever taught and maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: That is, <hi>Wee praiſe God for all thoſe that are departed this life in the faith of Chriſt;</hi> and pray, that they <hi>may have their perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and bliſſe, both in body and ſoule,</hi> &amp;c. And thus farre, <hi>Prayer for the dead</hi> is no <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:10652:35"/> and much leſſe <hi>Popiſh.</hi> For, wee maintaine no Suffrages for the reliefe of ſoules in the fooles-fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which prayers and <note place="margin">Artic. 22.</note> place wee condemne as <hi>fond things vainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rather repugnant to the word of God.</hi> So our Church-article ſpeakes: and in the ſame condemnation joines that other point of Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> charge: <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">Of praying to Saints.</note> taken at the beſt, and as the learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts defend it, deſerves that cenſure; and as it is commonly practiſed by the vulgar ſort among them, is not fooliſh onely, but flatly Idolatrous: And therefore juſtly exploded and condemned by all Proteſtants, and I dare boldly ſay, Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> cannot produce any one of thoſe whom hee endeavours to blemiſh, that holds or teaches that doctrine.</p>

It is not the Biſhops, but the diſobedient and ſeditious carriage of thoſe <hi>ill-affected perſons</hi> of the houſe of Commons, in the laſt Parliament, who raiſed ſo much heat and diſtemper, upon cauſeleſſe jealouſies: <hi>That His</hi>

                  <p>Of the Doctrine of the Sabbath and Lords-day, falſely accuſed of Novelty. The ſumme of what is held or denyed in this point by thoſe whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B. oppoſeth. The Churches power, and the obligation of her precepts. The maintainers of this doctrine have not ſtrained their braines or conſcience.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe laſt <hi>innovation</hi> in <hi>doctrine</hi> that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">pag. 126</note> is concerning the doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Lords-day:</hi> wherein, he ſaith, <hi>our novell Doctors have gone about to remove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it from the foundation of Divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo to ſettle it upon the Eccleſiaſticall or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power.</hi> Thus he. But in this (as in the reſt)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10652:41"/> he betrayes moſt groſſe and palpable ignorance and malice. 1. In that he accuſeth that doctrine of novelty, which was ever (as hath beene ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrated) the doctrine of the Ancient Church, and of the Church of England, and of the reformed Churches beyond the Seas, and the principall of the learned among them, as <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. 2. In accuſing thoſe that teach this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with <hi>removing</hi> the <hi>inſtitution</hi> of the Lords day from the foundation of <hi>divine Authority:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See B. of Ely p. 271. &amp;c. edit. 1.</note> which taken together, and as he delivers it, is moſt falſe: For <hi>They</hi> acknowledge the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>ſet times</hi> and dayes, to the publick and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip and ſervice of God, to be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>divine,</hi> but <hi>morall</hi> and perpetuall: and that the common and naturall equity of the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">B. of Ely, p. 120</note> obligeth all man-kinde to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They</hi> affirme, that the inſtitution of the Lords day, and other <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>definite</hi> dayes <note place="margin">2 De diſpenſ. &amp;c. c. 12. <hi>Quid enim intereſt utru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per ſe, an per ſuos miniſtros, ſive homines, ſive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos, hominibus innoteſcat ſuum placitum Deus.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, they grant, that the <hi>reſting from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> on the Lords day, and Chriſtian holy <note place="margin">3 B. of Ely, p. 121</note> dayes, in reſpect of the generall, is both groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the law of nature, and the perpetuall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10652:41"/> equity of the fourth Commandement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they grant a <hi>ſpeciall ſenſe</hi> of that <note place="margin">4</note> Commandement of perpetuall obligation: So that, they have not abſolutely removed the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Lords day from the foundation of <hi>divine Authority:</hi> Nor is the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly aboliſhed, as he falſely and unjuſtly clamours. That which they deny in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and concerning the <hi>fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> may be reduced under theſe heads:</p>
               <p>They deny the fourth Commandement to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wholly morall: ſo doth M. <hi>Burton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Particularly, they deny the <hi>morality</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> obligation of that Commandement, as it concernes the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> from the creation, which is our <hi>Saturday.</hi> And this is the Apoſtles <note place="margin">Col. 2. 17.</note> doctrine, who calls it a ſhadow, which M. <hi>Burton</hi> alſo granteth.</p>
               <p>They deny, that the peculiar manner of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſanctification of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> or <hi>ſeventh-day Sabbath</hi> in the obſervation of a ſtrict and totall <hi>reſt</hi> and ſurceaſe from ordinary labours, can, by vertue of that comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, be extended to the Lords day, or Chriſtian holy dayes, but that it (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the day on which it was required) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired and antiquated. And this alſo M. <hi>Burton</hi> muſt needs grant: 1. Becauſe there is the ſame reaſon of the <hi>day</hi> and the <hi>reſt</hi> required upon it; both being appointed for a memoriall of Gods <hi>reſt</hi> from his worke of <hi>creation,</hi> and other typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reſpects: 2. Becauſe otherwiſe he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his fellowes, and thoſe that ſide with him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10652:42"/> in this argument, who generally allow ſome <note place="margin">

               <p>They deny that the fourth Commandement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> determins the ſet time of Gods publick worſhip, either to one day in the revolution of <hi>ſeven,</hi> or to any other <hi>ſeventh,</hi> ſave onely that which is there mentioned; and that therefore the Lords day cannot thence bee ſaid to have its <hi>inſtitution,</hi> as being <hi>another day</hi> than that which the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſpeaks of; which, to conceive to be there meant, is to make the Commandement to ſpeake riddles and arrant non-ſenſe.</p>
               <p>They deny that there is any Commandement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> given in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for the obſervation of the <hi>Lords day:</hi> Though (they acknowledge) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground there to warrant the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and obſervation of that day. And this they ſuppoſe they may juſtly maintaine, till Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or ſome other of his mind, in this point, produce the place where it is <hi>written;</hi> which, if they would once do, they would eaſily bring off the Biſhops, and others who agree with them, to make a recantation, and to ſubſcribe to their better information.</p>
               <p>That which they aſcribe unto the Church in this argument is; 1. The inſtitution of the Lords day, and other holy dayes, that is, the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the time of Gods publick worſhip to thoſe dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The preſcription of the manner of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of theſe dayes, both for the duties to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10652:42"/> performed, and the time, manner, and other circumſtances of their performance.</p>
               <p>Concerning which, they affirme 2. things. <note place="margin">Biſhop of Ely p. 149.</note> Firſt, That the Church hath liberty, power and authority thus to do. Secondly, that Chriſtians are in conſcience bound to obſerve theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Church, and that they that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bern. de praec. et diſpenſ. c.</hi> 12. <hi>Obedientia quae majoribus praebetur, Deo exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, quamobre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quicquid vice Dei praecipit homo</hi> &amp;c.</note> them, ſin againſt God, whoſe law requires that we muſt obey every lawfull ordinance of the Church: And as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes, The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is given to Superiours (he ſpeakes of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and governors in the Church) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to God, wherefore whatſoever man in Gods ſtead commands (if it be not for certaine ſuch as diſpleaſe God) is no otherwiſe at all to be received, than if God had commanded it. For what matters it whether God, by Himſelfe, or by his Miniſters, men or Angels, make known his pleaſure to us? So hee, and much more to that purpoſe in that place. So that, they which maintaine the inſtitution of the Lords day to be from the Church, doe not thereby (as they are wrongly charged) diſcharge men from all <hi>tye of obedience,</hi> and give them liberty to obſerve it, or not, at their owne pleaſure: which no man will affirme, but thoſe onely who have learned to under-value and deſpiſe the Church of God, and her rightfull Authority.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe things have beene ſo fully proved, ſo plainly demonſtrated already, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yea impoſſible for me to adde any thing, and as impoſſile for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any other to gain-ſay,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10652:43"/> with any reaſon or evidence of truth. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot do, hee betakes him to (the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne hope of contentious ſpirits) railing againſt his oppoſers, and traducing the doctrine, which he knowes not how to confute. For his oppoſers; he ſaith, that (in this point) <hi>they have ſtrained all the veines of their conſcience and braines,</hi> and <hi>that they are ſo mad upon it, that no ſhame will ſtay them,</hi>

                  <hi>till confuſion ſtop their mouthes.</hi> But, God bee praiſed, they have not, neither need they much to ſtraine either: Their conſcience need not be ſtrained at all, in delivering that doctrine, and acknowledging that truth which is after godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And for their braines, it is not Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> Pamphlets, or lawleſs Dialogues, that can ſtraine them; No, nor his larger anſwer which he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, in anſwer to my <hi>L. of Elyes Treatiſe;</hi> which (were it not that ſimple and well meaning people might haply be ſeduced, and made to thinke them unanſwerable) were quickly anſwered, with that which beſt befits them, ſilence and ſcorne. As for that grave and learned <hi>Prelate,</hi> whom he uſeth with ſuch contempt and baſe language; The world hath ſeene his humility (joyned with that maſſe of learning which is lodged in that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable breſt) that he hath not diſdained to ſtoope to anſwer this railers railing dialogue of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> which hee hath done (like himſelfe) with great ſtrength and evidence of reaſon, and ſolidity of judgement; and yet (bleſſed be God) hath not <hi>ſacrificed</hi> the leaſt dramme of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which yet remaines (in ſo great yeares) to admiration quick

               </argument>
               <p>THis is all he ſaith of his ſuppoſed <hi>innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in doctrine:</hi> But before I part with this laſt point, I muſt annexe ſomewhat of his <hi>Majeſties Declaration concerning lawfull ſports to be uſed upon Sundayes;</hi> as depending here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and being the great pretended grievance in this argument.</p>
               <p>This Declaration, and the publiſhing of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Majeſties Royall intent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, hath afforded M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burton</hi> plentifull oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of calumniation, and cauſed him to utter many ſhamefull and ſlanderous invectives, not onely againſt the Declaration it ſelfe, but againſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10652:44"/> the Royall authority commanding, and thoſe, whom hee conceives procurers of it, or that in obedience to his Majeſty have urged the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of it, and puniſhed any that have obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed.</p>
               <p>For firſt hee hath endeavoured to blaſe the Honour of (that great Patron of the Church) K. <hi>Iames</hi> of Bleſſed memory, by an odious and baſe inſinuation of I know not what extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temper wherein the King ſhould be, when this Declaration was firſt publiſhed: a paſſage ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and execrably ſcandalous, that I will not ſo much as mention it.</p>
               <p>Nor hath he dealt better (but farre worſe) <note place="margin">2</note> with his ſacred Majeſty that now is, in making his <hi>reviving</hi> and <hi>republiſhing</hi> of his <hi>Fathers Act, to tend to the publick diſhonour of God, the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Commandement touching the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>the alteration of the doctrine of the Church of England, the violation of his ſolemne Royall prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations:</hi> all which and more, (ſuppoſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhing of this Declaration to be his Majeſties Act, and by his Authority) hee layes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties charge. Indeed hee ſeemes not willing that the world ſhould take notice of theſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies as directly ſent out againſt his Majeſty, and therefore would make men beleeve, that this Act was none of his Majeſties. But then I would <note place="margin">Declaration concerning the diſſol. of the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> demand of him, how he knowes any <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be ſet forth by his Majeſty? and in particular, how he knows that <hi>Declaration</hi> to be <hi>his,</hi> which he puts His Majeſty ſo often in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10652:44"/> minde of. Sure I am, he can have no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for any, than hee hath for this: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>name prefixed,</hi> his Royall <hi>Teſt ſubſcribed.</hi> And who is there (without danger of being found guilty of high treaſon) can counterfeit theſe? and what danger it may bee for men to queſtion or reject theſe, I leave to bee judged by thoſe that are beſt able and armed with Authority.</p>
               <p>But if it were his Majeſties, ſure it was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome ungracious perſons, and ill-affected to Religion. And who can they bee but the <hi>Prelates?</hi> and yet hee knowes not upon which of them to lay it: but hee would have the people to know whom to gueſſe at: For (hee ſaith) <hi>it was done preſently after the L. of Cant. tooke poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>

               <p>All which might very well bee, and yet <hi>his Grace</hi> have no hand in the procuring of it.

But what doe I goe about to vindicate His Honour, or to ſpeake in his praiſe, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of my praiſes, as well as of his revilings? It ſhall ſuffice me, that ſo judicious and religious a Majeſty hath paſt his Royall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon his merits, and judged him moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſit in the higheſt Chaire of this Church. To proceed then; The Declaration it ſelfe hee hath uſed in the ſame manner, that hee hath done the Authors of it; ſtiling it by all the names hee

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr the firſt, It is moſt evident to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Reader, that ſhall peruſe the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that his Majeſty intending onely to take away that ſcandall, which ſome <hi>rigid Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians</hi> had brought upon our Religion to the hindering of the converſion of Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and to allow (eſpecially to the meaner ſort) ſuch honeſt recreations, as might ſerve for their refreſhment, and better enabling them to goe through with their hard labours on other dayes. His Majeſty (I ſay) in this his charitable intention, did not forget his wonted reſpect to Piety, and the ſervice of God, or due ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:10652:46"/>
               <p> For firſt, Hee doth ſtraitly charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every perſon, firſt to reſort to his owne Pariſh Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hee doth expreſſely provide, that none ſhall have the benefit of the liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that will not firſt come to the Church, and ſerve God; thereby excluding all Recuſants, and idly profane perſons, who abſent themſelves from Gods houſe and ſervice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He doth enjoine, that they to whom it belongeth in office, ſhall preſent and ſharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all ſuch, as in abuſe of this his liberty, will uſe the exerciſes allowed before the ends of all Divine-ſervices for that day. Which things rightly cónſidered, if they be as well put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as they were piouſly intended by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, are ſo farre from hindering, that they are a great furtherance of the due ſervice of God upon that day; in as much as thereby, many that otherwiſe would not, may bee allured and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to preſent themſelves in the Church at the publicke worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Yea, by this meanes the publike worſhip and ſervice of God ſhall have its due honour, and be preferred before, even our otherwiſe honeſt and lawfull recreations; ſo as till that be ended, theſe cannot be uſed; nor by any that have not firſt in that tendred their duty to God; and if any ſhall preſume to doe otherwiſe, thoſe in Authority have power to puniſh them, and barre them from the benefit of their liberty, which (for ought I know) no Law, or Canon before, did ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to doe.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:10652:47"/>
               <p> It is manifeſt, in that his Majeſty doth onely <hi>permit,</hi> and not <hi>impoſe</hi> the uſe of recreations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Biſhop of Ely, p. 255.</note> any, which notwithſtanding, devout Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who are piouſly affected and able, may upon the Lords day ſequeſter themſelves from ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar buſineſſe, and ordinary pleaſures, to the end they may the more freely attend the ſervice of God, and apply their mindes to ſpirituall and heavenly meditations: which muſt needs bee a thing very commendable and acceptable to God; and farre from his Majeſties intention to diſallow, or to prohibit any, from incouraging men in ſuch courſes: onely hee would not have this impoſed as neceſſary for all, which no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> or <hi>Evangelicall precept</hi> hath done, nor is poſſible by all to be obſerved: all men not being morally able to apply themſelves for the ſpace of the whole day, to ſpirituall and religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and to divine Meditations onely.</p>
               <p>If then, by the Declaration, the publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God be duely provided for, no recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions permitted to the hinderance thereof, no nor the pious affections of well diſpoſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for the applying of themſelves on that day to private duties of devotion, and piety any way prohibited: Then it cannot juſtly be accounted any in-let to profaneneſſe, or irreligion, or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the due ſanctification of the Lords day, which was my firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Things may bee ſaid to bee unlawfull, either in themſelves, or in regard of ſome circumſtance of time, place, or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10652:47"/> manner, in which they may be uſed. The great exception which is by moſt men taken againſt the ſports and recreations allowed in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not ſo much in regard of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in regard of the day, on which they are permitted, when (though in themſelves law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as honeſt labours are) they judge them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable and ſinfull. But this hath beene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſufficiently cleared by the learned Biſhop of <note place="margin">See B. of Ely p. 237, 238. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Ely,</hi> and others, who have proved, that neither the Jewes under the Law, were prohibited all recreations on their Sabbath, nor (if that were not granted) could ſuch prohibition of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt Chriſtians, uſing of them upon the Lords day. Provided that the proper worke of the day, the publick ſervice of God be firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not thereby any way letted or impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there are ſome that will have the Recreations by the Declaration permitted, to be in themſelves unlawfull; and if ſo, then muſt they be againſt the law of God, or the law of the land. M. <hi>Burton</hi> will have them againſt both. <note place="margin">pag. 57.</note> 1. Againſt the law of the land: for which he cites the Act of Parliament in the 1. of King <hi>Charles.</hi> But in that Act none of the exerciſes or paſtimes allowed by the Declaration are mentioned, but onely, in generall termes, it prohibits all ſuch as are unlawfull, which the Declaration alſo doth; and that, not onely ſuch as are ſimply <hi>unlawfull,</hi> but all others forbidden <hi>by the law of the Land, as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Decla. p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>unlawfull, either on Sundayes, as Interludes, and</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:10652:48"/> 
                  <hi>Beare and Bull-baitings: or for ſome perſons, as bowling;</hi> an exerciſe by law prohibited the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort. And it were very hard to imagine, that his Majeſty ſhould confirm any Act of Parliament, which ſhould croſſe the Declaration ſet forth by his Royall Father not ſeven years before, at leaſt without expreſſe mentioning of it, and rendring ſome reaſon moving him ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, they are nevertheleſſe <hi>unlawfull,</hi> and, as ſuppoſed to be ſuch, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Burton</hi> will have them compriſed in that Act under thoſe generall words, <hi>All other unlawfull paſtimes; which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are thoſe? By name, all dancing, leaping, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, and ſuch like; in termes condemned by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall edicts, Decrees of Councells, writings of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, of all learned Divines both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Papiſts in all ages. And King</hi> James <hi>of famous memory in his Baſilicon Doron,</hi> whoſe words he there cites. He that ſhould reade this paſſage in M. <hi>Burton</hi> alone, and not know the man, would thinke him a man that did much eſteeme the writings of the Ancient Fathers, the Decrees of Councels, and conſentient teſtimony of Divines. But the truth is, it hath beene an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cuſtome with men of his ſtraine and humour, if they can but light upon any thing in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or ancient Councels, that ſounds to their liking; they catch hold of it preſently, and make a great ſhew and flouriſh with it, and both ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Authors ſhal have their due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <note place="margin">See Survay of the pretended holy Diſc. c. 26. &amp; 27.</note> But if any or all of them be brought to impugne their crotchets, they ſet light by their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10652:48"/> authority, and care not a ruſh for them: Bring them then the Scriptures, or nothing. I will not ſerve him in the ſame kinde, but (giving Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity its due honour) for anſwer to that which he alledgeth, I ſay firſt, That ſure the man is much miſtaken, and in his heat forgat himſelfe, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>leaping</hi> into the number of thoſe paſtimes, which he ſaith, are ſo condemned: For, I beleeve, he is the <hi>firſt man</hi> that ever ſo accounted it: and I am verily perſwaded, that in his ſad and ſober thoughts (if ever he come to himſelfe ſo farre, as to have any) he will exclude from ſo hard a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, both it, and <hi>archery,</hi> and <hi>vaulting,</hi> and ſuch like, though mentioned in the Declaration.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For <hi>Revelling,</hi> taking it in the uſuall ſenſe for drunken and diſorderly meetings, &amp;c. wee muſt ſubſcribe to the Fathers and Councels, and not to them onely, but to the ſacred Scripture, where they are plainly condemned as workes of <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 21.</note> the fleſh. And ſay withall, that it was one end that his Majeſty aimed at in this Declaration, to hinder ſuch <hi>Revellings,</hi> which he condemnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>filthy tiplings and drunkenneſſe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Decl. p. 6.</note> But if Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> intend by it, all thoſe other ſports mentioned in the Declaration, as Wakes, and Whitſon-ales, &amp;c. I ſay then, that hee is much wide in his conceit of them, they are no ſuch things: eſpecially in his Majeſties intention, who hath therefore given expreſſe charge for <note place="margin">Decl. p. 16.</note> the preventing and puniſhing of all diſorders in them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That then which remaines under the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10652:49"/> ſentence of condemnation, is onely <hi>Dancing,</hi> and, as I ſuppoſe, <hi>mixed dancing</hi> (as they uſe to call it) of men and women together; for ſingle dancing is not by the ſtricteſt diſallowed. As for <hi>mixed dancings,</hi> I know they may be abuſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawfull, by the immoderate and unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable uſe of them, and may otherwiſe, yea and they do many times become incentives unto luſt, and that two wayes eſpecially:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> when there are uſed in them ſuch <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt motions</hi> and geſtures, as have in them manifeſt tokens of a laſcivious mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> when they are done <hi>animo libidinoſo,</hi> with an intention to ſtir up the fire of luſt: where either of theſe are, they muſt needs become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
               <p>Now theſe, as they may be as well in ſingle dancing, ſo they are not in all mixed dancings, ſo as to make them all to be condemned. For what hinders, but that men and women may together expreſſe their joy in ſuch modeſt motions, and with as chaſt intentions, as they may otherwiſe walke, talke, ſalute, and converſe together? If any ſhall ſay, there is danger, becauſe of our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is prone to abuſe theſe to wantonnes; I ſay, ſo there is in other converſings of men and women together, but that danger not ſuch as to make either altogether unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Againe, I would know faine why men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (eſpecially where the cuſtome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try allowes it) may not as unblameably <hi>dance</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as for either ſexe to become <hi>ſpectators</hi> of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10652:49"/> others dancing? <hi>David,</hi> we know, danced in the ſight of women, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. and <hi>Miriam, Exod.</hi> 15. And (if we grant that the women danced <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſim à viris,</hi> yet) it cannot be denyed, but that they danced in the ſight of men: why then may they not doe it together? But they expreſſed a <hi>holy</hi> and religious joy, which our Country-dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are farre from: What if they did? will that hinder the creeping of impure affections into the mindes of the beholders? or muſt there be no dancing, but in expreſſion of ſpirituall joy? I ſuppoſe, no wiſe man will be ſo ſtrait-laced: and if not, then muſt they not condemne mixt dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (which have in them only grave and modeſt motions) becauſe mens corruptions may abuſe them to luſt and wantonneſſe.</p>
               <p>But doe not the ancient Fathers in the writings and Councels condemne them? So Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> indeed ſaith. But I anſwer: 'Tis true, that the Fathers and Councels ſpeake againſt dancings: But how? Not ſo as to condemne them as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unlawfull: but firſt, againſt dancings which are <hi>laſcivae, impudicae, meretriciae,</hi> for ſuch additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we finde in their invectives, and theſe wee no leſſe condemne than they. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſpeak againſt ſuch as did then ſavour of <hi>Gentilizing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;</hi> which, as the ſtate of the Church then ſtood, could not but be ſcandalous, and a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when, though they might haply be done with other intents and ends, yet, they ſaw the outſide of their rites retained.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:10652:50"/>
               <p> If any ſay that our Morris-dancing, and May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles doe alſo ſavour of heatheniſme (as Mr. <note place="margin">pag. 157.</note> 
                  <hi>Burton</hi> ſeemes to doe, when he calls them <hi>heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſports and paſtimes.)</hi> I anſwer, that things are not therefore rightly called <hi>heatheniſh,</hi> unleſſe there be ſomething in them, for which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might not uſe them. Now as for theſe, I know no impiety or other cauſe in them, why <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> may not uſe them as well as <hi>heathens,</hi> if they did or doe uſe any ſuch; for <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> doth not forbid men to doe any thing which the <hi>heathens</hi> did, but ſuch only as were contrary unto the law of God, and the law of right reaſon; neither doth it exact in all men a <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> or <hi>Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſeverity,</hi> to which theſe delights may ſeeme no better than folly: for grant, that wiſe men eſteeme of them, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of laughter and mirth, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 2. 2. yet will it not follow, that ſuch as by reaſon of their meane education and parts, hardly aſpire to know the pleaſure of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſhould not uſe ſuch, as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they ſpeake againſt dancing in ſome perſons, as in Prieſts and Churchmen; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dancing doth beſt beſeeme theſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Councells doe ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid dancing, as the <hi>Laodicean</hi> at marriages; and other Councels forbid <hi>Clericos,</hi> &amp;c. but this doth not prove them ſimply unlawfull: but they might ſee ſome abuſe in it, which might make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think it inconvenient to tolerate it, and ſo may our Church and State, upon ſuch abuſe, take away the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10652:50"/> uſe of it hereafter, as it hath done in many other things that are in themſelves lawfull.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, ſome of the Fathers more looking at the abuſe, than conſidering the lawfulneſſe of dancing, did ſometimes (in their Sermons and popular diſcourſes) cry downe all dancing, as we ſee it is uſuall with many in our times to doe the like in other things.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, ſome of the Fathers and Councels might haply reſpect the cuſtome of the Country. <hi>Nam pro more patriae &amp; provinciae quod alicubi laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civè &amp; impudicè fieri judicatur, alibi non fit laſcivè, ſed liberè &amp; honeſtè.</hi> Now, we know, the <hi>heathen Romanes</hi> had no good opinion of dancing, which among the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Countries was highly eſteemed of, and therefore they might cry out upon it, not as ſimply evill, but becauſe <hi>ſic mos patriae ferebat,</hi> to eſteeme ſuch light and vaine perſons who uſed it; and fit it is that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſhould avoid ſuch an imputation by abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but it being not eſteemed unlawfull among us generally, (but onely by ſome prejudiced againſt it) there is not the ſame reaſon with us and them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I verily beleeve, yea I know (how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily ſoever M. <hi>Burton</hi> ſeemes to affirme it) that neither the <hi>Fathers</hi> nor <hi>Councels</hi> doe with one conſent ſpeak againſt this recreation, as it is in uſe among us, if wee meane ſuch dancings as are permitted and intended by the booke: that is, of men and women publikely uſing this exerciſe, where I cannot conceive how they ſhould ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10652:51"/> themſelves, as to uſe any laſcivious geſtures; neither doe I beleeve, that if the Fathers lived among us, they would eaſily condemne a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtome.</p>
               <p>However, their condemning of dancings dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from ours, in nature and in places, where uſages were different, or to ſome perſons, or for ſome abuſe they found, &amp;c. cannot preſcribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our dancings, unleſſe they can prove them both for nature and circumſtances to agree with them. Neither can the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Edicts (if haply any ſpeak for M. <hi>Burton)</hi> preſcribe to us, or bound our liberty, for that wee are not under that law, no nor prove the thing prohibited unlawfull: all that can thence upon good grounds be deduced, is, that the makers of ſuch Edicts (all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces weighed) judged ſuch things not fit to be tolerated among them. Yet haply, our caſe and theirs being not the ſame, they may be lawfull for us. We know there are many things prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Statutes, which are not unlawfull, but onely inconvenient in regard of the time, place, or perſons, in which, and to whom ſuch things ſhall be ſo prohibited.</p>
               <p>For example, no man can truely ſay that <hi>Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or <hi>ſhove-groat,</hi> or other exerciſes by <hi>Statute</hi>

               <p>As for that he addes, that all learned Divines, Proteſtants and Papiſts, and in all ages, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. It is ſo palpably falſe, that it needs no confutation; otherwiſe it were eaſie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a large Catalogue of Authors of both ſorts, that are ſo farre from condemning them, that they allow and approve them in themſelves, conſidered as not prohibited on the Lords day, if they be not uſed with exceſs, nor have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>But for his judgement, I ſay, that it weighs not much in this caſe: for Firſt, he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in judging of things indifferent. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why ſhould his opinion ſway in this, more than in the point of the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> ſurely there can no reaſon be given why we may not reject him in this, as well as Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> and others uſe to doe in that.</p>
               <p>That which he alledgeth out of <hi>King Iames</hi> of famous memory, his <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his purpoſe, and it is ſo farre from croſſing the intent of the Declaration, that it ſpeakes rather for it, for when he ſaith, he would have no unlawfull paſtimes uſed on that day; what is more ſaid than in this Declaration, which is for no other but lawfull ſports? And therefore neither did K. <hi>Iames</hi> croſſe his owne judgement, nor our Gracious Soveraigne, <hi>the Peereleſs Sonne of ſo Peereleſs a Father,</hi> herein diſobey his Royall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10652:52"/> Fathers inſtructions, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> labours to make the world beleeve, nor yet (though hee falſely affirmes it) <hi>doth that judicious King expreſly and by name, forbid May-games as unlawfull on that day.</hi>

               <p>Here is one marginall that I cannot paſſe, <hi>viz. Bellarmine in his Sermons in many places copiouſly declameth againſt ſuch profanations: as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have elſe where expreſſed at large:</hi> where this <hi>elſewhere</hi> is, he tells us not, but we finde it in the booke called <hi>A Divine Tragedy,</hi> which (though it went abroad without his name) it ſeemes he is willing the world ſhould take notice of, to bee <hi>his,</hi> and (though the ſtile and ſtraine ſpeake ſo much to the judicious, yet) thinks fit to put it paſt <hi>peradventure.</hi> As for the places of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> which he citeth, I know not what he meanes by that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tranſlates, <hi>mummeries</hi> and <hi>dancings</hi> (for I have not thoſe Sermons by me) but if he meane (as hee ſeemes to expound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>Bacchanals, drunkenneſs</hi> and diſorders, we joyne with him, <hi>and condemne them ſimply at all times, but eſpecially on ſacred feſtivals.</hi> But I do not thinke him ſo farre a <hi>Puritan</hi> (to uſe Mr. <hi>B's.</hi> owne phraſe) to condemne <hi>all dancing,</hi> either ſimply, or on Feſtivalls, if it bee after <hi>divine Service</hi> ended: or that hee hath ſaid any thing to contradict that which I finde delivered by a prime <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> and one of his owne <hi>ſociety;</hi> with whoſe words I will conclude this Propoſition: <note place="margin">

               <p>For the third, It is a part of Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt this Declaration, <hi>That it is a</hi>

That it breakes two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in the Decalogue at once, the laſt of the firſt table, and the firſt of the ſecond, and ſo cuts aſunder the very ſinewes not onely of Religion, but of all civill ſociety at one blow:</hi> Thus hee ſpeakes, and I have heard ſome ſimple people muttering ſome ſuch thing; but no man to ſpeake out in ſo broad language as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But no matter who ſpeakes it; ſure it is an evill thing, and worthy to be aboliſhed, that ſhall thus violate Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10652:53"/> by <hi>couples:</hi> and were it not that this charge is (as his others uſe to be) a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in one thing (which we call <hi>truth)</hi> I ſhould (not ſo much as I do) diſlike thoſe men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to publiſh it. Let us then conſider his proofes. All that I finde by him alledged (though there bee more than enough of it) may well be reſolved into his <hi>private opinion</hi> boldly vented and <hi>faced</hi> with certaine <hi>interrogatives;</hi> which perhaps hee miſtooke for good <hi>reaſons</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> where no man would or durſt contradict him. For I finde him ſpeaking (in many more words) after this manner. <hi>Should Miniſters in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>their Congregations declare how the Iuſtices of Aſize in their circuits are commanded, that no man trouble or moleſt any in or for their lawfull recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Alas! then what ſhall Parents and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doe, when their ſons and ſervants will abroad, and take their liberty of ſports, at leaſtwiſe after evening prayer every Lords day, and will ſtay out as long as they pleaſe.</hi> A heavy caſe, no doubt; and becauſe the man (by the moane he makes) ſeemes to bee in ſome diſtreſs; I'le reſolve his doubt, and free him from his perplexity. <hi>Alas! what ſhall they doe?</hi> Marry, give them ſuch <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> as befits ſuch rebellious and diſobedient ſons and ſervants, that ſhall dare to take upon them to be their owne Carvers in their liberty, with contempt of thoſe whom the Law of God and Nature, commands them to honour and obey. But this plaiſter ſeemes too narrow for his ſore; for he addes, <hi>gladly would they reſtraine</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:10652:54"/> 
                  <hi>them, but they may not, they dare not, for feare of being brought to the Aſsizes, there to be puniſhed.</hi> No? may not? dare not? Surely a man by this, may ſweare <hi>Mr. Burton</hi> never read the <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> or if hee did, is very dull of underſtanding, or very willing to miſtake. For, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when ever <hi>Mr. Burton,</hi> or any man elſe knew a <hi>father</hi> or <hi>maſter</hi> bound over, or brought to the <hi>Aſsizes,</hi> for reſtraining his <hi>ſonne</hi> or <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi> or where this danger is intimated? It ſaith indeed, That <hi>the Iuſtices of Aſsize, ſhall ſee that no man doe trouble, or moleſt any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties loyall and dutifull people, in or for their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full recreation, having firſt done their duty to God, and continuing in obedience to his Majeſty and his Lawes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is all this to <hi>parents</hi> and <hi>maſters?</hi> ſhall they loſe their authority, and government over their children, and ſervants? God forbid. Were that true, then indeed farewell all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Superiours, whoſe firſt modell and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is laid in private families. But, God bee thanked, there is no ſuch thing: Neither 1. in the Book, wherein the names of ſervants, or children are not once mentioned, but the perſons for whom the liberty is granted, ſuppoſed to be <hi>ſui juris.</hi> Nor 2. in the intention of it; for all that is ſpoken, is of publike hindrance and mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, by the publike Magiſtrate or Officer, whoſe office ordinarily, and in ſuch caſes is not exerciſed <hi>inter privatos parietes,</hi> within private walls, at leaſt, not without expreſſe order to that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10652:54"/> purpoſe. So that every man is ſtill free, and hath as full power to order his family, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe bounds to his children and ſervants liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as before. Yea, they may, if they pleaſe (as too many uſe to doe in this caſe) notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Declaration, prove <hi>Tyrants</hi> in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their authority.</p>
               <p>But why doe I bring reaſon to the confutation of ſo groſſe a ſlander, when it is reaſon enough to convince it of falſe-hood, that in all this noiſe, hee cannot bring the leaſt ſhew of reaſon for it. That which he brings of a ſtory of <hi>three Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, upon the occaſion of reading the Book</hi> (ſo M. <note place="margin">p. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Burton</hi> will have it, and I liſt not to contradict him in ſuch trifles) <hi>going to a Taverne, ſpending ſixe ſhillings there, and concluding to runne from their Maſters, and after executing it.</hi> All this (if malice did not make men ridiculouſly blind) might be, and yet the Book, or the reading of it, no cauſe of it, otherwiſe than the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that <hi>perfect law of liberty,</hi> whereby men are freed <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note> from the bondage of the <hi>ceremoniall Law,</hi> may <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> be uſed as an <hi>occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>cloake of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſſe,</hi> that is, not by any defect or fault in <note place="margin">1 Pet 2. 16.</note> it, but by the corruption and perverſeneſſe of men. And there may, and be ſome (no doubt) that in like manner, doe abuſe this Booke, and turne the <hi>liberty</hi> granted, into <hi>licentiouſneſſe;</hi> which was piouſly and charitably intended, for the honeſt comfort and refreſhment of <hi>labouring perſons.</hi> For where doth the Book give liberty to any (much leſſe to ſervants and ſuch as are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10652:55"/> under others) of <hi>tipling,</hi> or <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> or of going to <hi>Taverns,</hi> or <hi>Alehouſes</hi> on Sundayes? <note place="margin">Declar. p. 8.</note> When the preventing of <hi>filthy tiplings,</hi> and <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe</hi> was one end of giving liberty of the uſe of more honeſt and manly refreſhments.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, that the <hi>Wakes</hi> and ſetting up of <hi>May-poles</hi> are not without <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> and <hi>diſorders:</hi> My anſwere is; that however, the Book is not in fault, which expreſſely commands <hi>all Iuſtices and other Officers to whom it belongs, to prevent and puniſh thoſe and all other diſorders,</hi> among which we may reckon that for one. For <hi>ſervants</hi> to turne <hi>rebels</hi> to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> under pretence of this liberty granted. And if they to whom this charge, by His Majeſties Royall Command is given, faile in their duty, the blame muſt bee laid upon them; and let <hi>Mr. Burton</hi> in ſuch caſe, turne his invectives (a Gods name) againſt them, and not againſt the Booke, to the blaſting of His Majeſties pious and Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, who is farre from robbing either God of his worſhip, or his ſubjects of the obedience which is due to them from their ſervants and children; and ſo no violater either of the fourth, or fifth Commandement.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat the reading of the Booke by Miniſters in their ſeverall Congregations, was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and intended by His Majeſty; and that it is a thing that may lawfuly bee done by them:</hi> Both theſe are denied by Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and the <note place="margin">p. 55.</note> latter brought as a reaſon to the former, thus. The thing is unlawfull, <hi>As tending to the publike</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>diſhonour of God, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, <hi>the King did not, nor can any honeſt man imagine that he ſhould ever intend to command it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a common fetch of his, and it is very prety, to paſſe a falſe ſentence upon his Majeſties juſt and pious actions, and then to charge thoſe actions upon others, that ſo hee may the more freely vent his invectives againſt them, and yet ſeeme, in the midſt of this his great ſeeming-zeale, to retaine his dutifull and loyall reſpect of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10652:56"/> his Majeſties honour. If a man ſhould deale with Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> in the like kinde, and ſay, he did not traduce his Majeſties government, incenſe the people to ſedition, and raile upon his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, the Governours of the Church, for that were againſt the <hi>duty</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of a <hi>ſubject,</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and againſt his <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and his often <hi>proteſtations</hi> of <hi>loyalty</hi> to his Royall Majeſty, &amp;c. Therefore (though ſuch things have gone abroad under his name) ſurely they were none of his; hee never intended, nor was Authour of ſo foule and wicked practiſes: If, I ſay, a man ſhould ſpeake thus (as any man might do, and yet not as he hath his Sacred Majeſties) falſely cenſure his actions in the leaſt) there is <note place="margin">Argumentum ad hominem.</note> no man of reaſon and diſcretion, but would think this to be no <hi>excuſe,</hi> but rather an <hi>aggravation</hi> of his fault; ſo long as the evidences, of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is charged, are ſo plaine and convincing, that they leave no place for doubting: for what other conſtruction can bee made of ſuch maner of ſpeech, but onely this? That Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> hath done contrary to the <hi>duty of a Chriſtian, of a ſubject, of a Miniſter, and violated his oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and often proteſtations of boyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I anſwere briefely: That his Majeſty (as his <hi>Royall Father</hi> had alſo done) commanding <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Declar. in fine.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Declaration, by order from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops through all the Pariſh-Churches of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Dioceſes reſpectively,</hi> did implicitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that <hi>Miniſters ſhould reade it.</hi> For 1. how doth publication uſe to bee made of ſuch things
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10652:56"/> in the Church, otherwiſe than by the Miniſters reading of them? But 2. I know no man of common ſenſe, but will confeſſe, that what order any man, to whom the making of ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is committed, ſhall make, that order (what ever it bee) is <hi>his</hi> who gave the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty in his Declaration, authorized <hi>the Biſhops</hi> to take order for the publication of it, and ſeeing <hi>their</hi> order was, that it ſhould be read, and that by the Miniſters; Then may it (without preſumption) bee ſaid, That His <hi>Majeſty</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Miniſters to reade it; unleſſe it might ſome way appeare, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> did reſtrain them from making that kinde of order, or limit them to doe it in ſome other way, which hee did not in the Booke, I am ſure, and I am confident Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> cannot prove hee did otherwiſe, and therefore it is ridiculouſly falſe that <hi>M. Burton</hi> ſaith, <hi>His Majeſty did command no ſuch thing, as that Miniſters ſhould reade the Booke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay further, that Miniſters may lawfully (and therefore ought) to obey his Majeſty in reading the Booke. For 1. The matter of the Booke is not unlawfull, nor againſt any Commandement of God, as hath beene already proved. 2. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (not granting) that the things declared in that Book to be permitted, were not lawfull, and ſuch as cannot be uſed without offence to the Divine Majeſty, and tranſgreſſion of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and that therefore his Majeſty (which is ſinne to imagine) had unjuſtly granted ſuch liberty: yet will it not follow, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10652:57"/> to read the Declaration, &amp; publiſh his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure. For Miniſters by reading it doe not <hi>juſtifie,</hi> but <hi>declare</hi> what is done, nor do they thereby <hi>ipſo facto</hi> approve the liberty granted, or the granting of it, but make knowne his Majeſties pleaſure what ever it be, which (for ought I could ever learne) is not by God forbidden any man to doe.</p>
               <p>It is lawful ſomtimes for Subjects to obey their Superiours in that which by them is not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded. <hi>David</hi> ſinned in cauſing the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to be <hi>numbred,</hi> but no man can (with reaſon) ſay, that <hi>Ioab</hi> ſinned in <hi>numbring</hi> them, but that on the contrary, he had <hi>ſinned</hi> if he had not <hi>numbred</hi> them. For there, the ſinne was not in the <hi>act,</hi> but in the <hi>motive;</hi> which in <hi>David</hi> was <hi>pride</hi> and vain-glory; in <hi>Ioab, obedience</hi> to his Soveraigne. So alſo, and much rather in this caſe, where the acts are not the ſame; and (what ever the other is) the act required to be done by Miniſters (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion) is of the ſame nature with thoſe, in which (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) <note n="a" place="margin">

The Subject may not deny his Soveraigne his obedience, becauſe he feares that which is commanded, is not agreeable to Gods will; or becauſe he cannot ſee the word of God for it; or becauſe ſome doubt of the lawfulneſſe of it. He that will doe nothing at the command of his Superiours, which is doubted of by any, whether it be lawfull or no, will pin up his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within very narrow bounds, and prove but a bad ſubject. It is our own conſcience, not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that muſt be our guide in matters of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Powers ordained by God.

Though a man muſt love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his neighbour as himſelfe, yet he needs not,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10652:58"/> he muſt not, in this caſe, love him more or before himſelfe: but if it come to that, that the one muſt be neglected, here every man muſt think himſelfe his neareſt neighbour, and preferre himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is it ſufficient to excuſe our diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to ſay, God hath not in his Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any ſuch thing as man requires. For this were to deny all obedience to man, whoſe power is properly in thoſe things which are left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Word of God. It is ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for us, to know the things by humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity commanded, not to be <hi>forbidden</hi> by God in his Word, and that they are not contrary to that which God commands; which every thing which he hath not commanded, cannot, with reaſon, be ſaid to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt be plainly ſuch. This contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety muſt evidently appeare, not doubtfully ſeem: to commit a certaine ſinne, to avoid an uncertain, is no point of wiſdome or religion. It is a good rule I confeſſe, if rightly applyed, <hi>In doubtfull things ever to take the ſafeſt courſe.</hi> But this cannot (though ſome ſo uſe it) be any preſcription for <hi>diſobedience</hi> to humane authority: For the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here is not between two things that are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but betweene an evill certaine, and that which is doubtfull: as namely, whether a man ſhall diſobey his Superiours, (which without all queſtion is a ſinne againſt God, and the power by him ordained) or ſhall doe that which he knowes not whether it be a ſinne or no? here it cannot
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10652:59"/> but be a fond choiſe, to chooſe to ruſh upon that <hi>ſinne,</hi> which is <hi>certaine,</hi> for the avoiding of that which is <hi>uncertaine.</hi> In thoſe things which the Scripture hath manifeſtly delivered to be the will of God, we are not (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>

This muſt needs be to obey (not <hi>God,</hi> but) our owne opinion, rather than men: and to preferre our private fancies and ſelfe-will, before the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which God hath exacted as due to thoſe, whom he hath inveſted with part of his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and placed in authority over others.</p>
               <p>To our preſent purpoſe then; I would demand of thoſe that refuſe to obey Authority by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to reade the booke, whether it be manifeſt that God hath forbidden the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it? Or where it is written that they ſhall not (at the command of Authority) reade that which they conceive not to be orthodoxe? or to refuſe to publiſh their Soveraignes royall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, unleſſe that which it containes, be (in their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10652:59"/> opinion) juſt and right? But this without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are not able to doe, nor is it reaſonable to thinke that ever God ſhould ſuſpend the power of Superiours, upon the liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thoſe from whom hee requires o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them. And if they cannot, let them feare, leſt refuſing to yeeld obedience, and ſo <hi>reſiſting the power and the ordinance of God, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>

               <p>If any of them, who was forward and noted for <hi>profeſsion,</hi> turned <hi>bankrupt,</hi> and robbed the fatherleſſe, and widowes, and were the undoing of many others, they were wont (till of late, that it is ſo common among them, that they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beyond all excuſe) to be much troubled, and to uſe ſtrange ſhifts to palliate the buſineſſe, and to remove the ſcandall that thereby might befall the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and their <hi>profeſsion.</hi> But if any of them be detected of any <hi>villanie,</hi> for which the ſword of juſtice cuts them off; Lord! what hurly-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are raiſed? how doe they ſeeke, to excuſe, to extenuate the fact? and uſe all their ſtrength for the hindering of the execution of juſtice upon the malefactor? and if they cannot prevaile, they cry out of <hi>injuſtice</hi> and malice in <hi>Iudge</hi> and jury, againſt the ſincere Profeſſors of Religion: as it happened not many yeares paſt, when one of them, dwelling (as I remember) in Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fryers, was condemned and executed for a <hi>rape,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That which they will haply ſay upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, is, that the height of that <hi>profeſsion</hi> doth not exempt them from <hi>falling</hi> (I will not ſay from grace, but) into the <hi>fouleſt ſinnes;</hi> and ſuch, as that if <hi>any other</hi> ſhould doe the like, they ſhould think they had reaſon to feare their <hi>title</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and miſtruſt their aſſurance: they are farre from branding the whole <hi>profeſsion,</hi> with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion of ſuch bloudy ſinnes; yet they may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of the <hi>profeſsion</hi> it ſelfe, (not of <hi>Religion,</hi> but of their <hi>New-forme of godlineſſe)</hi> 1.

               <p>But I find my ſelfe to have digreſſed too farre: To draw my anſwer to this crimination into a briefe and more diſtinct forme and ſumme: To the firſt part, or intimation, that <hi>vicious perſons, adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. are not now <hi>cenſured:</hi> my anſwer is (as before) that it is <hi>notoriouſly falſe,</hi> and till hee bring better proofs for what he ſaith, that anſwer is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, that <hi>Gods people</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> are cenſured: I ſay firſt, There are none that are rightly ſo called (in diſtinction to others) that are cenſured. 2. None are cenſured as, or for being ſuch. 3. Granting, that ſome that are <hi>Gods people</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> (for I will not exclude them out of the number of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which are all <hi>Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi> or (which is their meaning) ſome <hi>honeſt,</hi> and <hi>good men,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> are and have beene cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Churches diſcipline; ſo long as it is for <hi>offences</hi> by <hi>them</hi> committed, (from which they cannot exempt themſelves, unleſſe they can be exempted from the common condition of all
<pb facs="tcp:10652:67"/> mankinde) their puniſhment can neither be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed an <hi>innovation,</hi> nor a <hi>perſecution:</hi> but an act of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and of that <hi>impartiall diſcipline</hi> which hath ever beene exerciſed in this Church, and in every well ordered Church and State Politick. <hi>Iuſtice</hi> lookes not at the <hi>perſon</hi> of any man, but at the <hi>cauſe;</hi> She waighs the <hi>offences</hi> of delinquents in her impartiall ballance, while her eyes are blinded from all reſpect of <hi>perſons.</hi> Good men falling may deſerve more <hi>pity</hi> from others, but muſt receive the ſame doome at the barre of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which others, guilty in the like kind and meaſure.</p>
               <p>But haply the edge of cenſure is more ſharpe <label type="milestone">

                  </label> againſt them then other men, or then their crime deſerves; which if it be, they have good cauſe to cry out of an over-ſeverity and injuſtice.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. 1. That the cenſured are but ill and very partiall Judges of their owne Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; there are but few that (though convict of a crime) would paſſe ſentence upon themſelves by the rule of juſtice, without ſome favour; though they and their favourers (who for the moſt part are partakers of the ſame guilt, and in feare of the ſame puniſhment) cry out of cruelty and perſecution, it is not much to bee valued in this caſe. 2. In the cenſure of ſinnes and offences they are not altogether to be rated by the <hi>atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the fact, or by the law that is violated, but by other <hi>circumſtances,</hi> whereby it comes to paſſe that a ſlight offence, in it ſelfe conſidered, and againſt a poſitive and humane law or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10652:67"/> may ſometimes (without violation of juſtice) be as deepely cenſured, as ſins of an higher nature, and againſt the morall and eternall law of God: and this is approved for good juſtice by all common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in caſes of <hi>treaſon</hi> and the like, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, a little aberration or word miſ-placed, is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced with <hi>death:</hi> Yea, God himſelfe, who is the Judge of all the world, and muſt needs do right, did ſet this <hi>pattern</hi> of judicature in the firſt ſentence that was pronounced in the world, ſentencing <hi>Adam</hi> and all his <hi>poſterity</hi> with <hi>death,</hi> not for the violation of any law of nature, but of the <hi>poſitive precept</hi> of eating the <hi>forbidden fruit:</hi> which (being a thing not for it ſelfe acceptable to God) may ſeeme but a ſmall ſin in compariſon of thoſe that are againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in as much as by that ſin man did as it were <hi>renounce</hi> his ſubjection, and <hi>diſclayme</hi> his obedience to his Maker, whereof that precept was given for a <hi>ſymbole</hi> or <hi>teſtification;</hi> God, in this (as in all other his actions) muſt needs be juſtified. In like manner, if the violation of the orders of the Church, being in themſelves matters of <hi>ceremony</hi> rather than of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of Religion, receive as heavy cenſures, or, perhaps more grievous, then the breach of the <hi>morall Lawes</hi> of God himſelf. Yet is not authority preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unjuſt (beſides that they are of more dangerous conſequence than others) or cruell; conſidering that theſe offences, when they come to be ſo cenſured, are heightened by <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> and ſeconded by <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtification,</hi> and contempt and condemnation of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: which if it ſhould not, with all ſeverity, be repreſſed, would induce in ſhort time a meere <hi>anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> and confuſion in the Church.

               <p>I Come now to the third kind of <hi>innovations</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be made in the worſhip of God; which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burton ſaith, they (the Biſhops) goe about to turn inſide outward, placing the true worſhip which is in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, in a will-worſhip of mans deviſing &amp;c.</hi> This is the crimination: which is ſet forth in moſt odious maner, but proved as weakely as the former: for whereas he pretendeth an <hi>Innovation</hi> in the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> he produceth nothing, but certaine <hi>ceremonies</hi> or <hi>uſages</hi> which cannot be accounted parts or any thing of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of Gods <hi>worſhip,</hi> ſuch as are; <hi>bowing at the name of Ieſus, bowing toward the Altar, turning toward the Eaſt, ſtanding at the Goſpell,</hi> and (which he produces for another example in this kind <note n="a" place="margin">pa. 98.</note> elſewhere) at <hi>Gloria Patri, reading the ſecond Service at the Altar.</hi> Theſe and ſome other like, mentioned by him in other places, are by him charged: as, 1. <hi>Innovations</hi> lately brought in. 2. That they are made <hi>part</hi> of Gods worſhip. 3. That they are <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:10652:68"/> and (as often elſewhere he calls them) <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous.</hi> Laſtly, he taxeth the <hi>rigour</hi> which is uſed in urging of theſe things, and puniſhing the refuſers of them in the <hi>High-Commiſsion</hi> &amp;c. my anſwer ſhall be briefe, yet ſuch as may give ſome ſatisfaction to the ingenuous in all theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder with what face he can accuſe any of theſe things of <hi>novelty,</hi> when there is not one of the things he names which hath not been uſed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and pureſt ages of the Church; and though, by the diſaffection of ſome, and the careleſneſs and negligence of others, they have beene, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſome while, too much neglected, were never wholly <hi>out of uſe</hi> in this Church of ours, but obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as <hi>religious cuſtomes</hi> derived from the <hi>ancient</hi> Church of Chriſt, and that not onely in <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and the <hi>Royall Chappell,</hi> (though that might ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare them from theſe foule imputations) but in many <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches in this Kingdome; and generally, by all, that to their knowledge, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded zeale and conſcience by their practiſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the honour and reputation of the pious and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> of the <hi>ancient Church:</hi> And how theſe things can be more <hi>popiſh, ſuperſtitious,</hi> and <hi>idolatrous</hi> now, then heretofore, I cannot ſee.

<pb facs="tcp:10652:69"/> no man can deny, but that to riſe up and ſtand is a more reverent geſture than to ſit or leane: and if that bee but granted, this ſolemne doxology may worthily challenge that this is the more reverent poſture: and if we may ſtand at the reherſing of the Apoſtles Creed, to ſhew our conſtancy and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to maintaine that faith which we there profeſs, (which I perſwade my ſelfe no man will call an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation) much more at this hymne which is both a compendium or ſhort profeſſion of our faith, and a ſong of praiſe to God. As for the leaſt ſhew of <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> or <hi>idolatry</hi> in this cuſtome, I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelfe cannot charge it; being onely the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of praiſe to the onely true God in three glorious perſons in a ſeemely manner and with reſpect to his greatneſſe and Majeſty.

               <p>Laſtly, both this and the reſt here queſtioned, are moſt injuriouſly, and ignorantly termed, <hi>Will-worſhip of mans deviſing.</hi> Every thing of mans deviſing, in the worſhip and ſervice of God, is not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Will-worſhip: If that rule ſhould hold, many things which they hold in high eſteeme, would deſerve that name.

               <p>And here, 1.

Theſe are but accidents, which alter not the nature and uſe of it, but that though theſe vary, yet ſtill it remaines both a <hi>Table</hi> and an <hi>Altar,</hi> in the ſenſe that I have mentioned. And that it may be placed at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end of the Church, according to the ancient and moſt received faſhion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world: Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunction for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">Injunction for Tables in the Church.</note> is warrant ſufficient, which appointeth it to be <hi>ſet in the place where the Altar ſtood, and not thence removed, except at the time of the Communion, for more conveniency of hearing and communicating.</hi> Which, if it may be as well there (as in ſome places, without queſtion it may) as in any other part of the Church or Chancell, for ought that I can ſee, it may ſtand there ſtill. And however, the <hi>placing</hi> of it, as of appointing the place for the reſt of the Service of Morning and Evening prayer, and the <hi>deciſion</hi> of all <hi>doubts</hi> about Ceremonies, is left to the diſcretion of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> as is evident out of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the beginning of Morning prayer, and the Preface
<pb facs="tcp:10652:72"/> prefixed to the Booke of Common prayer. In caſe then that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> (which is every Biſhop in his Dioceſe) ſhall appoint it to be ſo <hi>placed;</hi> hee doth no more, but what he hath pattern for from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church,</hi> and by warrant from the <hi>Injunctions</hi> mentioned, and Booke of <hi>Common prayer</hi> it ſelfe; that I ſay nothing of the <hi>Epiſcopall power,</hi> which was never abridged of liberty to take order in things of this, nor of farre higher nature.</p>
               <p>I will adde one thing more. That that place is of all others the moſt <hi>fit</hi> for the ſtanding of the Lords Table, becauſe (as S. <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quia corum quae apud nos ſunt meliora &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiora, ad Dei honorem ſecerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, hominum autem opinione &amp; ſententia, ea pars in qua ſol oritur, caeteris na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae partibus praeſtantior eſt, orientem cum precamur omnes intuemur.</hi> S.

                  <hi>Thoſe things which are the beſt and moſt excellent with us, we ſet apart for the ſervice of God; and for that in the opinion and judgement of men, that part where the Sunne riſeth is the chiefe of all the parts of created Nature, wee looke to the Eaſt when wee pray, for that cauſe:</hi> And as that part of the Church hath beene ever accounted the <hi>chiefeſt,</hi> ſo it is great reaſon that our beſt ſervices ſhould thence be tendred unto God, and that his Table ſhould have the higheſt place in his owne houſe, and no man ſuffered to perk above it and him.</p>
               <p>And if it may bee there placed, and (in caſe the <hi>Ordinary</hi> ſhall think that place convenient for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration) there remaine; Then can it not (as ſome think, and as the <hi>Ipſwich-libell</hi> glancingly intimates) be unlawfull, for the Communicants <hi>to goe up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> when they receive. As for the cuſtome (which in too many places is of late crept in) of the Prieſts carrying of the <hi>holy Bread,</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> to every perſon in their ſeats, it is both unſeemly, and derogatory to the Majeſty of thoſe ſacred Myſteries: and I am
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10652:72"/> ſure, beſide the intention of our Church, expreſſely commanding all thoſe that intend to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, to <hi>draw neere</hi> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is alſo the intention of the often mentioned <hi>Injunction,</hi> when it appoints the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the holy Table, from the place where the <hi>Altar</hi> ſtood, <hi>that the Communicants more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and in more number might communicate with the Miniſter.</hi> For what need any <hi>removing</hi> for that, if the Miniſter muſt carry the Sacrament to every man? Who ſees not but that the whole Congregation, though never ſo great, may communicate with the Miniſter, and the Table ſtand ſtill at the <hi>Eaſt end,</hi> or any where, if communicating with him were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that ſenſe? But without all doubt, the intent of the <hi>Injunction,</hi> was that Communicants ſhould goe out of their places, and <hi>draw neere</hi> to the Table when they did receive, and care was thereby taken, that as many as might with conveniency, ſhould, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there, Communicate.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>railes</hi> alſo offend, as well as the <hi>ſite,</hi> and <note place="margin">Of railes.</note> have afforded ſome matter of <hi>railing</hi> and calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> ſeemes angry at them becauſe they <hi>inſinuate into the peoples mindes an opinion of ſome</hi>

                  <hi>extraordinary ſanctity in the Table, more than in other places of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> But I wonder at him, and for my part, thinke it very fit, that that place be <hi>railed</hi> off, and ſeparated from common acceſſe and danger of <hi>profanation,</hi> as finding it practiſed in ancient times: and 2. that ſuch an opinion of ſanctity ſhould by all means be inſinuated into the peoples mindes. What? Sanctity and holineſſe in the Table? I, in the Table; but how? this holineſſe is not any internall, inherent quality infuſed, transforming the nature of it, but an

               <p>Now in regard of this ſpeciall preſence of God in this place, it is, that Chriſtians have in former times, and ſome at this day, uſe to tender their ſervice to him, directing their faces that way. For though we doe not (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſlanders) <hi>tie God to a fixed place,</hi> yet wee doe (not without good cauſe and warrant from Scriptures) acknowledge different <hi>maners,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of his gracious preſence. He is (we confeſſe) truely preſent in all places, and (as the Prophet ſpeakes) <hi>fils heaven and earth;</hi> yet there is no man that underſtands any thing in Divinity, but will ſay, <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 24.</note> he is otherwiſe <hi>in heaven,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>in earth;</hi> there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10652:73"/> as in his <hi>throne,</hi> here as on his <hi>foote-ſtoole:</hi> for which <note place="margin">Eſay 66. 1.</note> cauſe we are to direct our prayers to him, not as by us, or in us, (though he be both) but as above us, and to ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> In earth <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> Gods preſence is not every where alike: God is preſent in all things, being <hi>not farre from every one of</hi>

                  <hi>us, for in him wee live and move and have our being.</hi> Yet he is not ſo in the <hi>brute creatures</hi> as in the <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi> nor ſo in the <hi>wicked</hi> as in his <hi>Saints;</hi> nor ſo in <hi>other things</hi> as in his owne <hi>ordinances</hi> of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; nor yet in all of them by the ſame <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>exhibition of grace,</hi> as in ſome; and namely, in that of the <hi>bleſſed Euchariſt,</hi> where he diſplayes the riches of his glorious Grace in the repreſentation and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vertue of that <hi>all-ſaving Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſts body and blood. To looke that way then where God is wont thus graciouſly to be found, can be no act of groundleſs ſuperſtition, miſguided zeale, or empty forme of godlineſs, but true piety and ſound religious devotion. To acknowledge Gods preſence in one place, is not to deny it in another. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place:</hi> will any one ſay, that <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 16.</note>

And from whom the Church received the cuſtome of praying, from them alſo it received where to pray, that is, from the Holy Apoſtles.</hi> Thus that ancient <hi>Father</hi> and holy <hi>Martyr,</hi> who wrote about 150. yeares after Chriſt, and ſo lived not long after the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>From which words we may obſerve <hi>foure things,</hi> which being conſidered and laid together, may give reaſonable ſatisfaction to any man. 1. That hereby God is not tyed to any <hi>fixed place,</hi> or abridged in his omnipreſence. 2. That God being <hi>every where,</hi> may be found, and ſo be worſhiped <hi>any-where.</hi> 3. If any where, then in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> whither we direct our faces when we worſhip him. If that in worſhiping we muſt looke ſome one way or other; I would demand then why we may not doe it toward the Eaſt, according to the cuſtome uſed in the Primitive and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church, and received from the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10652:74"/> Yea, why may we not do it toward the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> where he, ſo more than ordinarily exhibits his gracious preſence? For my owne part, I am yet to learne, why we ſhould be ſaid to tye God to a <hi>fixed place,</hi> more, than thoſe <hi>ancient Chriſtians,</hi> when <hi>wee</hi> onely doe as <hi>they</hi> did.

               <p>To theſe pretended <hi>Innovations</hi> hee hath added <note place="margin">Of reading the ſecond Service at the Altar.</note> one other yet, and ſurely he did it onely to increaſe the number of them, thinking that any thing ſhufled in any how might paſſe in the croud.

                  <hi>HIs fourth kinde of Innovation is in the Civill Government, which hee ſaith, They (the Biſhops) labour to reduce and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Eccleſiaſticall, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>he ſaith,</hi> but beſide ſome clamors <hi>of oppreſsions and tyranny exerciſed by the Prelates over the bodies, goods, and conſciences of the Kings Subjects,</hi> &amp;c.

To which I ſay (as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Hooker</hi> did to ſome of his brethren in his time) that <hi>a bare deniall is anſwer ſufficient to things which meere fancie objecteth, and ſilence the beſt Apologie to words of ſlander</hi> and petulancy. But I cannot ſo well paſſe over his <hi>marginall note,</hi> which is the onely particular inſtance that hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, or rather directeth us to finde in another place, <hi>viz. The Biſhop of London</hi> (now Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury) <hi>in the High Commiſſion threatning thoſe that ſhould bring Prohibitions in that Court.</hi> And this wee find pag. 54. related in this manner. <hi>A Rule for a Prohibition for Maſter</hi> Prinne, <hi>being tendered in Court according to the</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:10652:76"/> 
                  <hi>courſe of the Kings Lawes in that behalfe, preſently my Lord of London, then Preſident of the Court, ſtands up and flies in the face of Maſter</hi> Prinne <hi>and his Prohibition with great heat of paſſion, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unto fury, and after many threatnings to him, he uttered theſe words, that whoſoever ſhould dare to bring the next Prohibition, hee would ſet him faſt by the heeles. This,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>was ſpoken alowd in open Court.</hi> And then he runnes his uſuall deſcant upon it, and him that ſpake it; adding in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this wholeſome note; <hi>A moſt audacious and preſumptuous ſpeech of a Prelate, ſetting his proud foote upon the Kings Lawes, as the Pope did once on the Emperours neck, an Embleme of perpetuall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,</hi> and concludes, <hi>That the beſt Apologie that he can make, is, that his tongue did runne before his wit, and that in the flames of his paſſion he ſacrificed his beſt reaſon and loyalty.</hi> But ſoft a while. The man ſurely is much miſtaken, if hee thinke as hee ſpeakes: Bleſſed be God, that moſt reverend and ſacred Prelate, is not ſo neare driven, as to make any ſuch <hi>Apologie,</hi> which is both notoriouſly falſe, and if true, were fooliſh, and not able to purge, but increaſe the crime objected. He can make one farre better, and more true. And it is but ſhort, onely this; <hi>That there were no words ſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> That which was ſaid, was ſuch as may ſtand with the wiſedome and loyalty, which is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in that eminent Antiſtes, as the true ſtory will make manifeſt, which in briefe was this: <hi>Prinne</hi> being to be cenſured, the Advocates having ended their pleading, and the judgement of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10652:76"/> Court being (according to the uſuall courſe) by the Preſident (then Biſhop of London) deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the ſigne given for that purpoſe; <hi>Prinne</hi> (as if hee had watcht his time, to baffle them, and put a dorre upon them, which might be notorious and make them ridiculous and jeer'd by the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſteps out, and in an unmannerly faſhion, and without any reverence, produces his <hi>Prohibition,</hi> with which ſawcy behaviour of his, my Lord of London, juſtly moved, ſaid to this effect; <hi>That if any man hereafter ſhould in that manner (N. B.) bring a Prohibition thither, hee would ſet him by the heeles, or lay him faſt.</hi> This was the effect of his ſpeech (the words I remember not ſo well) and this was the truth of the ſtory: to which there are many, and thoſe of untainted credit and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that (if need were) will be ſworne; who were preſent, and as neare as Maſter <hi>B.</hi> when the words were ſpoken; among whom, occaſionally, I made one.</p>
               <p>Now I appeale to any (that is not in the ſame gall of bitterneſſe) whether this were any <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daring of the Kings juſt Government of his ſubjects, any infringing of the ſubjects rights and juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, any croſsing of his Majeſties gracious ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Petition of Right, any trampling or ſetting a proud foot upon the Kings Lawes, or any audacious and preſumptuous ſpeech of one that in the flames of his paſſion hath ſacrificed his beſt reaſon and loyaltie.</hi> All which Maſter <hi>B.</hi> is pleaſed to brand it with.

And if this be not to doe contrary to the Kings Declaration, nothing is. And therefore this was no <hi>dangerous</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi> charge; but by his anſwer, hee hath laid ſuch a one upon the King; <hi>That he is an inſtrument of ſuppreſſing Gods</hi> truth, which certainly, he can be no more juſtly charged w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, than S. <hi>Paul</hi> for willing men <hi>to be wiſe unto ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,</hi> &amp; not to be <hi>wiſe above that which is writen.</hi> This was all that was intended, by His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie; <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3. 1.

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:10652:78"/> 
                  <hi>men ought not to be ignorant, nothing handled of thoſe things which we may not or cannot know ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> All therefore that I will here adde, is, that by queſtioning and ſuſpending Maſter <hi>B.</hi> for this cauſe, nothing was done contrary to either of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Declarations, nor was it any <hi>pernitious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,</hi> nor laying of any <hi>burden</hi> upon the <hi>King,</hi> which is injurious or diſhonorable to His Majeſty, as I doubt not but Maſter <hi>B.</hi> will be told by thoſe (to whom hee referres it) who are beſt able to judge of matters of ſuch moment.</p>
               <p>To this he addes another inſtance in the ſame place, but it concerned not His Grace, but Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Mountague;</hi> and beſides, it is notable for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but his impudent bragging of his <hi>ſilencing the High Commiſſion Court</hi> by his brave retort and recharge of ſedition upon them: which, if true, were enough (if there had beene nothing elſe) to juſtifie that which followes, of his <hi>committing to priſon without Bayle or mainepriſe.</hi> And it is ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for any to thinke the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> (which he and his brethren uſe ſo much to talke of) is, by this or the like act, <hi>infringed,</hi> that I ſhould juſtly incurre the imputation of folly to anſwer it. For who ever dreamt that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie by <hi>ſigning that Petition,</hi> intended to barre himſelf from giving power to his Commiſſioners to commit an offender to priſon without bayle? And therefore it could be no <hi>impious or diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeech,</hi> nor ſuch as could bring any <hi>people</hi> (which were not willing to catch at any thing for that purpoſe) <hi>into a hard conceit of his Majeſtie,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:10652:79"/> which, he ſaith, was uttered by my <hi>Lord of London</hi> that then was; <hi>That the King had given expreſſe charge for him;</hi> which hee might very well doe, being informed of his offence, and throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the temper of the man. But this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way.</p>
               <p>The other accuſation intended againſt <hi>His Grace,</hi> is for his <hi>Entertainment</hi> of our Royall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which both for the magnificence, and for the orderlineſſe, ſo every way commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo acceptable to his Royall and Moſt Gracious Maſter, and ſo full an expreſſion of a gratefull affection toward ſo Munificent a Patron; ſo lively a demonſtration of his Graces admirable dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous wiſdome, and ability to manage great affaires: that I had thought, <hi>Envy</hi> her ſelfe would have been ſtrucken ſpeechleſſe, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; or if ſhe could have ſpoken, would have loſt her wont, and have come in with her <hi>panegyrick.</hi> But Maſter <hi>B.</hi> can ſee nothing in it to pleaſe him; the <hi>perſons entertayned,</hi> the <hi>Entertayner,</hi> the place, the time, all ſerve him only for furniture of a ſatyricall declamation; and make the Entertaynment an <hi>iniquitie not to be purged till he dye.</hi> But ſtay; was this the firſt time that ever His Majeſtie, or His Royall Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours being entertained in the Vniverſities, have beene preſented with a <hi>Comedy?</hi> And why then ſhould it bee a crime for <hi>His Grace</hi> to entertaine His Majeſtie in the ſame manner?

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10652:79"/> Nay, why ſhould not a <hi>Comedy</hi> bee thought more requiſite at that time, than at others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the entertainment was intended alſo for <hi>His Majeſties Royall Conſort</hi> and others, not ſo capable of other <hi>Academicall exerciſes?</hi> and yet there wanted not (that which Maſter <hi>B.</hi> eſteemes the only piece of Piety) a godly and learned <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> neither was there any <hi>Comedy</hi> which was halfe ſo ſcurrillous as theſe Sermons, or the <hi>Ipſwich</hi> libell; nor ſo much in diſgrace of <hi>true piety</hi> and <hi>vertue:</hi> unleſſe we doe (as he doth) miſtake and call the turbulent and ſeditious humors, the uncharitable and ſupercilious cenſurings, or the vaine &amp; ſenſeleſſe crotchets &amp; traditions maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; uſed by thoſe of his faction, by the names of <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>piety:</hi> Theſe perhaps might there receive (what they deſerve) <hi>diſgrace</hi> and <hi>laughter.</hi> But that <hi>true vertue and piety</hi> were <hi>diſgraced,</hi> no man can ſay either truly, or without lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that aſperſion upon the religious Majeſty of our Dread Soveraigne, as the hearts of loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects abhorre once to conceive.

                  <hi>part, I am aſhamed that ever it ſhould be ſaid, you have lived a Miniſter, under ſuch a Prince and ſuch a Prelacie, and ſo farre forgot your duety to both.</hi> But perhaps it was the time which cauſed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, this happening, when the <hi>Plague</hi> was at <hi>London;</hi> otherwiſe hee had paſt a milder cenſure upon it: but it troubled his zeale to ſee or heare of any rejoycing, when the City wherein he was, had cauſe of mourning. And truly it cannot bee denyed, but that Gods Judgements ſent abroad and (among others) this of the Plague, doe call for weeping and mourning and amendment of life, not for feaſting, and much leſſe for wicked mirth. But, bleſſed be God, the plague that then was (and yet remaines) was not at that time in ſuch heat and height to cauſe a generall mourning all the Kingdome over: No, nor to cauſe ſuch a mourning in that Citie where it was, as that all ſober mirth and feaſting, all marriages ſhould be there prohibited in that time, which though in ſome great calamities it be very neceſſary; in ſo moderate and fatherly a chaſtiſement as this, would have argued impatience, and have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to that mercie, which in the midſt and height of this <hi>judgement,</hi> our Gratious God was pleaſed to <hi>remember.</hi> Yea, I appeale to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>B.</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:10652:80"/> owne conſcience, whether, both at that time and after, when the plague was hotter than at that time it was, he himſelfe was not preſent at ſome feaſts or good cheare? whether hee did not at a full table cry out upon the times, and upon the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and heare <hi>them traduced,</hi> and that with as much <hi>content</hi> and delectation, as His Majeſtie and his traine could take at a Comedie? And why then muſt it bee imputed as an <hi>inexpiable crime</hi> in a place ſo remote from danger, for any to entertaine His Majeſtie with a feaſt and <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?</hi>

As for that for which hee brings this, and the other inſtances. <hi>viz. To prove</hi> that <hi>the Biſhops</hi> (whom hee calles the Popes Factors) <hi>doe by theſe practiſes labour to divide the King from his good Subjects, and bring Him to have a hard opinion of the good Miniſters of the Land, and the Kings moſt loyall, loving, dutifull, faithfull, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, peaceable Subjects.</hi> I ſay, firſt, that if hee meane himſelfe and his party (as it is out of all queſtion hee doth, for wee ſhall never finde him to grace any others with thoſe titles) His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie hath ſuch experience of their <hi>love</hi> and <hi>loyalty,</hi> (ſuch as it is) that hee needs no <hi>informers,</hi> nor need M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>B.</hi> feare (till they alter their courſes) that ever His Majeſtie will (or any of thoſe hee aymes at, goe about to) alter his deſerved opinion of them. Secondly, if the words bee taken in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10652:81"/> their latitude, and as they ſound. I ſay onely two things. Firſt, That it is a meere ſlander and groundleſſe calumnie. Secondly, That if they ſhould act their parts in that way with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, as devoutly, and with as great zeale, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>B.</hi> and others of his faction have done theirs with the people, (or to ſpeake more plainly) if they ſhould as earneſtly endeavour to bring His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to have as hard an opinion of His Subjects, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burt.</hi> hath done to bring the Subjects to have of His Majeſtie; all things had long before this beene in a combuſtion, if not arrived at a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ruine and deſolation.

               <p>THe fift Innovation (hee tels of) is in <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Prayer-bookes ſet forth by publick Authority.</hi> And this (out of the zeale hee

Let us briefly inquire what the matter may bee that thus moves his patience. Firſt, he tells us of <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> made in the <hi>Communion-booke, ſet forth by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In the editions ſince 1619.</note> 
                  <hi>Parliament within this ſeventeene or eighteene yeares, as in the Epiſtle for the Sunday before Eaſter. That In the name of Ieſus, is turned into, At the name of Ieſus.</hi> Surely, a <hi>mighty alteration,</hi> and which toucheth the ſubſtance of Religion, and worſhip of God; To read it in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> as it is uſed to be read in the <hi>Leſſon,</hi> when that chapter is appointed: for ſo it is there turned both by (his friends) the <hi>Genevians,</hi> and our laſt <hi>Tranſlators.</hi> But hee hath a matter of other-like moment than this. <hi>In the Collect for the Queene and Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie, they have put out [Father of thine Elect and of their Seed:]</hi> This he keeps a foule pudder about, and in the Epitome they cry out; <hi>O intolerable</hi>

                     <hi>Newes Ipſ. p.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>impiety, affront, and horrid treaſon!</hi> and puts it in the title-page, to ſtartle and amaze the readers at firſt daſh, and make them cry ſhame upon the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But (if I could take the man in coole bloud) I would demand of him; <hi>who</hi> made that prayer? If hee ſay (as hee muſt) it was made at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>King Iames</hi> his raigne; I would aske <hi>by whom?</hi> If he ſay, by the Biſhops; I ſhall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his petitioner to bee informed; why they may not as well alter it, when the occaſion cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well as make it to ſerve the preſent occaſion of thoſe times? If he ſay, as hee here intimates,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10652:82"/> that it was ſet forth by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> let him produce the Act that was made for that prayer, &amp; then I ſhall ſay more to him. But for all that, it is not to bee ſo ſlighted, for it ſounds little better than <hi>high treaſon,</hi> to daſh the <hi>Queene and Royall Progeny</hi> out of the number of Gods Elect. Wee may very well let Maſter <hi>B.</hi> boaſt of <hi>his loyalty,</hi> when hee gives ſuch experiment of it by his zeale in detecting <hi>traitors</hi> &amp; treaſonous practiſes. But in good earneſt, doth he think it <hi>treaſon?</hi> truly, I can hardly beleeve he doth: but if he or any other (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his ſermons and libels) ſhould; I will, by asking a queſtion or two, get them aſſoyled from ſo heavie a charge. For how if this Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were (as indeed it was, and for that cauſe alter'd) before the Kings Majeſty had any <hi>Royall Progeny?</hi> Sure then it could bee no treaſon, hee may perhaps (if there be any ſuch) call it treaſon in the <hi>roote,</hi> which in time may grow up to bee treaſon; though at firſt, it was no ſuch thing, but an act done upon good ground and reaſon. But he is not very confident that they doe <hi>exclude</hi> them out of the number of <hi>Gods Elect;</hi> it is, but <hi>(as it were,</hi> or, <hi>as if)</hi> nor can hee doe otherwiſe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it is no neceſſary conſequence to ſay, they doe not, when they pray for them, addreſſe their prayers to God, by the name of <hi>Father of his elect and of their ſeed,</hi> therfore they doe not think them they pray for, to bee of Gods Elect. But what if Maſter <hi>B.</hi> himſelfe doe indeed <hi>exclude</hi> them, and doe not thinke them to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Gods Elect?</hi> Will it be <hi>intolerable impiety</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:10652:82"/> and <hi>horrid treaſon</hi> ſtill? No queſtion it muſt bee the ſame crime in him and them: <hi>perſons</hi> doe not ſo difference <hi>acts,</hi> whoſe <hi>objects</hi> are the ſame. And that this uncharitable and moſt unchriſtian-like Chriſtian man is of this opinion, were eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate out of his ſenſeleſſe bookes againſt my Lord of <hi>Exon</hi> and Maſter <hi>Cholmeley,</hi> were it fit for me to proſecute this argument. But he hath a <hi>pretty ſhift</hi> for that, and by the helpe of a <hi>mentall reſervation,</hi> can uſe that <hi>clauſe</hi> well enough: For, though he doe not beleeve them to be <hi>Elect</hi> to an <hi>Eternall Crowne</hi> (ſuch is the wiſedome and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this black Saint) hee beleeves that they are to a <hi>Temporall.</hi> And this is intimated in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, where the leaving out of this clauſe is made to imply, that they which did it, made <hi>them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and none of the number of Gods Elect, either to a Temporall or an Eternall Crowne.</hi> By which, men may judge, with what <hi>faith</hi> ſuch as Maſter <hi>B.</hi> uſe to ſay the <hi>prayers</hi> of the Church; and what ſtrange ſenſes they are faine to put upon them, to fit them to their fancies. And this is no new thing with them, but practiſed a long time, eſpecially in the prayers at Baptiſme, when, after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred, Wee <hi>give God humble and hearty thankes, for that it hath pleaſed him to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> the Infant baptized. Where they uſe to underſtand ſome ſuch clauſe as this [If hee bee elected] or as I have heard ſome expreſſe it [as we hope:] by which device, they can, without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conſcience, both ſubſcribe, and uſe the prayers of the Church, which, in the Churches
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10652:83"/> ſence, they doe not beleeve, or aſſent to. But this onely by the way.</p>
               <p>The next booke that (he ſayth) they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is that which is ſet forth for <hi>ſolemne thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for our deliverance from the Gun-powder Treaſon. In the laſt Edition whereof, inſtead of this paſſage</hi> [Root out that Babyloniſh and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſect, which ſay of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> down with it &amp;c.] <hi>They read</hi> [Root out that Babyloniſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſect <hi>of them</hi> which ſay &amp;c.] <hi>and little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for [whoſe religion is rebellion, and faith facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] <hi>they read</hi> [who <hi>turne</hi> religion <hi>into</hi> rebellion, and faith <hi>into</hi> faction.] For anſwer to this, I ſay firſt; That thoſe prayers were not (as he falſely affirmes) ſet forth by authority of Parliament. The Act of Parliament (which is obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that reads that book, being prefixed to it, and appointed to bee read on thoſe dayes) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes the keeping of that day <hi>by reſorting to the Church at morning prayer;</hi> but mentions no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prayers either ſet forth, or to be ſet forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for that purpoſe. If he know any other act that authoriſeth them; I ſay to him, as be to my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> (and I hope I may doe it with leſſe ſawcines) <hi>Let him ſhew it.</hi> Then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">pag. 72.</note> I ſay, that being done by the ſame Authority that firſt ſet them forth, it is neither for him, nor me, nor any other of inferiour ranke to queſtion them, but with humble reverence to ſubmit to their iudgements, and to thinke them wiſer and farre more fit to order thoſe things that belong to their places, than we, whom it neither concernes,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10652:83"/> nor indeed can know the reaſons that move them, either to doe or alter any thing. But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; that which he obiecteth againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is: That they would not hereby have <hi>all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites and Papiſts termed a Babyloniſh and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſect, but restraine it to ſome few of them, and mentally transferr it to thoſe Puritans who cry, downe with Babylon, that is Popery.</hi> But what then? what if out of a charitable reſpect to thoſe which in that Religion are honeſt and peaceable men, (as, no doubt, but ſome of them, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Maſter <hi>B.</hi> beleeves of them, are ſuch) they are not willing, nor thinke it fit, to pray for the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up and confuſion of all Papiſts, <hi>indiſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> under thoſe harſh termes? ſurely, charitably minded Chriſtians cannot but approve ſuch an <hi>alteration,</hi> if there were no other ground than that for it. As for any mans <hi>transferring it to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes,</hi> that is as meere a ſurmiſe, as it is a falſe ſlander, that any of thoſe whom he intimates, doe <hi>call Rome, Ieruſalem; or Popery, the true Catholick Religion:</hi> Yet I know not why ſuch <hi>furious cryers downe of Popery,</hi> as Maſter <hi>B.</hi> hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, may not bee accounted of a <hi>Babyloniſh and Antichriſtian ſect,</hi> as well as any <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in the world, nor why we may not pray (and that with better reaſon than Maſter <hi>B.</hi> would have men to doe, and under thoſe titles, againſt the Hierarchy of our Church) that God would roote them out of the land, when they cry ſo loud (not of <hi>Rome,</hi> but) of <hi>our Ieruſalem,</hi> (the truely and rightly reformed <hi>Engliſh Church)</hi> Downe with it, down with it even
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10652:84"/> to the ground. To the other, his exception is, that <hi>they which made that alteration, would turne off Rebellion and Faction from the Romiſh Religion and faith to ſome perſons, as if the Religion it ſelfe were not Rebellion, and their faith Faction.</hi> But he craves leave <hi>to prove it ſo to bee, according to the judgement of our Church, grounded upon manifeſt and undeniable proofes:</hi> and without expecting the grant of what hee craves from any (but his good M<hi rend="sup">rſ</hi>. the People) hee ſets upon it; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forgets his promiſed brevitie, for he ſpends almoſt five leaves in that Argument. And leſt I forget my promiſe in the ſame kinde, Ile ſumme him into a very narrow roome. 1. <hi>Their Religion</hi>

                  <note place="margin">pag. 142.</note> 
                  <hi>left out [Thou haſt delivered us from ſuperſtition and Idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned, and haſt brought us into the moſt cleere and comfortable light of thy bleſſed Word, by the which we are taught how to ſerve and honour thee, and how to live order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our neighbours, in truth and verity.]</hi> But what of that? <hi>Loe here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe men</hi> (the Biſhops) <hi>would not have Popery to bee called Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, nor would they have the Word of God commended, as that cleare and comfortable light which teacheth us all duties to God and man.</hi> But the man is farre and wide from truth in this fond conjecture; I dare boldly ſay, there was no ſuch thing thought on. It is out of queſtion (for ought I know) with <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that in <hi>Popery</hi> there are many groſſe <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Idolatries;</hi> and that the <hi>Word of God</hi> is that cleare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable light, which teacheth us all things <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation.</hi> But men may be good <hi>Proteſtants</hi>

               <p>But ſecondly, <hi>they have left out a whole Collect:</hi> true, and perhaps it was thought fit ſo to be; not for any thing conteined in it, but only to <hi>abridge the length of the ſervice,</hi> which I know ſome of Maſter <hi>Burton's</hi> humour did as much grumble at, when that <hi>firſt booke</hi> was appointed, and tooke more liberty of ſhortening it, than that comes to. His conceit, that they did it, <hi>becauſe in it preaching was commended,</hi> is groundleſſe, and the dreame onely of a diſtemper'd fancy, and ſhall receive from me the anſwer it deſerves; <hi>ſilence.</hi> And that is the beſt anſwer alſo that I can give to that which followes, about the <hi>clauſe left out in the laſt page, in the order for the Faſt,</hi> which he would have the people beleeve, was done becauſe they eſteemed <hi>faſting a meritorious worke:</hi> but ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſhew of ground or reaſon, that it were a vanity (ſecond to none but his) to ſpend time and words about it. And what hath Maſter <hi>B.</hi> or any other to doe with the <hi>leaving out of the Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth and her children?</hi> which hee might well beleeve was done, either not without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties conſent, or at leaſt, that would ſoone come to His knowledge, who Himſelfe had the ſame
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10652:87"/> prayers read in his <hi>Royall Chappell.</hi> Nay, Ile tell thee more, it was exactly done according to the laſt edition of the Common prayer-booke, and His Majeſties ſpeciall direction in this particular, as Maſter <hi>B.</hi> and I have beene often told by our betters. Surely, it was a great overſight, that when Maſter <hi>B.</hi> was turn'd out of the Cloſet, hee was not made Maſter of the Ceremonies, to determine what was fit to be done for the entertainment of the Prince Elector, and other States and Princes that reſort to His Majeſties Court; ſeeing, for want of ſome ſuch <hi>able Director,</hi> they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this <hi>ſoleciſme,</hi> &amp; therein given ſuch <hi>an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable affront</hi> (as he and his <hi>Ipſwich</hi> brother call it) <hi>to that Lady and her children, even while they are now royally entertained at the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the reſt, <hi>the prayer for the Navy,</hi> every man knowes the occaſion was ceaſed; and I wonder he did not mention the <hi>Prayer for the Parliament,</hi> which was alſo left out, and would have help't to have increaſed the number of his <hi>exceptions;</hi> and this did no more, nor thoſe that follow, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out <hi>ſundry Pſalms and Collects, &amp;c.</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they produced the ſervice to that length that it was thought very tedious, (eſpecially by ſuch as uſe not to bee over farre in love with the Church Liturgy) were well left out, as being, ſome of them, choſen to fit the various occaſions of <hi>thoſe times</hi> for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were apppointed, which were now <hi>ceaſed.</hi> And though the ſpeciall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for <hi>ſeaſonable weather</hi> were left out, yet there were prayers remaining, wherein petitions were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10652:87"/> made for that end, both in the <hi>Letany,</hi> and in the new-added prayers (which perhaps ſome like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and ſo there were petitions made <hi>for all that travell by land or by water;</hi> ſo that it might rather be thought that the <hi>ſtormes, flouds, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks</hi> that after happened, were becauſe men did uſe thoſe prayers they had, without devotion and affection, and not that they wanted more pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to make for that purpoſe. God (we know) is not taken with many words or loud cryes: and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>let thy words bee few,</hi> and <note place="margin">Eccle. 5. 2.</note> thoſe few words, breathed out of a devout and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate heart, ſhall prevaile more with the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> than long-winded exerciſes, or wier-drawn Oriſons proportion'd to the length of the hower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe by the beſt-guifted conceptioniſt.</p>
               <p>But I paſſe to his other exception, <hi>the reſtraint of preaching upon the faſt dayes:</hi> which was thought fit for the <hi>avoyding of the danger</hi> of contagion that might grow by the concourſe of people; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting, they were moſt apt to take the <hi>infection,</hi> which by wiſer than he was thought to have been a good meanes (next to the devout prayers of the Church) for the decreaſing of the plague. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that upon our weake humiliation (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the want of Sermons) the plague du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring al the time of the continuance of the Faſt, did weekely decreaſe, as was plainly demonſtrated by M. <hi>Squire</hi> in his religious <note n="a" place="margin">Reade that ſermon which is ſince printed and intituled; <hi>A Thanksgiving for the decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Plague.</hi> pag. 52. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>and his wayes paſt finding out;</hi> ſo that (though it be familiar with Maſter <hi>B.</hi> to frame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for his purpoſe from them) it is <hi>impious preſumption</hi> peremptorily to aſſigne any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon, either of their firſt infliction, or their progreſſe or continuance; and there is nothing in the world, wherein men may, and doe ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foole themſelves, than in reading the obſcure Characters of Gods judgements, if once they paſſe the bounds of ſobriety, and preſume to bee wiſe above that which is written. But if hee would needs point out the cauſe of the plague &amp; its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Why did he not rather impute it to the murmurings &amp; ſeditious railings againſt governors and government which he &amp; too many more are guilty of, ſeeing the Scripture teſtifies, that for the <hi>like cauſe,</hi> the like and greater plagues befell the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereas they never give any example, <note place="margin">Num. 16. 3, 41, 46.</note> that God did plague any for want of a Sermon at a publick Faſt, as was worthily obſerved by the <hi>author</hi> of the fore-cited ſermon. As for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (I take it in Maſter <hi>B.</hi> ſenſe, for expounding and applying of Scripture) I honour it; and if it be as it ought, eſteeme it as a principall meanes for the inſtruction of Chriſtian people in the waies of godlineſſe: but for any abſolute neceſſity of having a ſermon or more at a Faſt; I never yet ſaw either reaſon or Scripture alleaged to any

                  <hi>Faſting, praying, and Preaching are the chiefe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes and cure againſt the Plague;</hi> There is not one of them, that hath any word of <hi>Preaching,</hi> but onely mention of <hi>Faſting, and Praying, and amendment of life,</hi> as meanes for that purpoſe. His places are, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 28, 29, 30. <hi>cap.</hi> 7 13, 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. and therefore I ſay (with that worthy man) <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the places, and deteſt the falſe dealing.</hi> But this opinion of the neceſſitie of Sermons at a publick Faſt (as I take it) is built upon another, (which with many paſſes for currant, though in truth) as groundles as it ſelfe: and that is, <hi>That a Faſting day ought to bee kept as a Sabbath,</hi> and ſo to have all the duties of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> performed in it. Men muſt no leſſe in the dayes of Faſting abſtaine from their ordinary, and bodily labours, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon the <hi>high place</hi> which they have exalted above <hi>Gods Altar twice,</hi> at leaſt, upon every of thoſe dayes, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Prieſts lips</hi> in a Prayer and Sermon produced to a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary length. Now the grounds which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a Faſt to bee kept as a Sabbath, are 1. that in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 31. 32. where the day of <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Feaſt of <hi>Expiation,</hi> is commanded to bee kept as a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and day of <hi>reſt</hi> from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>from even to even:</hi> and 2. that of <hi>Ioel</hi> 1. 14. Commanding the <hi>Iewes</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie a Faſt, and call a ſolemn aſſemblie.</hi> But the weakenes of their Arguments, from theſe places to inferre that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10652:89"/> Concluſion, is manifeſt: 1. becauſe, being onely <hi>particular</hi> to thoſe <hi>Faſts</hi> there ſpoken of, they cannot in reaſon bee extended to preſcribe any <hi>generall</hi> Rule for all <hi>Faſts,</hi> as neceſſarily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, according to their pattern. Particularly, the former place was a <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> precept, whoſe obligation laſted no longer than till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The other in <hi>Ioel</hi> is altogether as weake, and concludes no ſuch thing. For to <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,</hi> is no more than to <hi>proclaime, appoint, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or prepare,</hi> as the word is elſewhere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioel</hi> 3 9. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 12.</note> tranſlated, and that upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and though it bee admitted in that ſpeciall ſenſe, in which they take it, yet is the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſſely referred, not to the day, but to the Faſt, which in regard of the religious ends, and uſes of it, may bee truly called an <hi>holy,</hi> or <hi>ſanctified</hi> work; and ſo cannot inferre any Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſanctification of a day (much leſſe of every ſuch day) for that worke. 2. Neither doth the <hi>ſolemn aſſemblie</hi> neceſſarily import it, the word being of more generall ſignification, and ſome times applyed to ſuch aſſemblies as are farre from <hi>holines;</hi> and however (as I ſaid before) being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>particular</hi> command, cannot be drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">

               <p>THE <hi>ſixth Innovation</hi> (he tells us) <hi>is about the meanes of the Knowledge of God, and of the myſterie of our ſalvation,</hi> where in hee charges the <hi>Prelates,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi> That <hi>they ſhut up the Kingdome of Heaven againſt men, and neither goe in themſelves,</hi>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>nor ſuffer them that were entring to goe in. Which</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:10652:90"/> (ſaith he) <hi>in</hi> Luke 11. 52. <hi>is expreſſed thus: Yee take away the key of knowledge.</hi> And then hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his meaning, after a confuſed clamorous manner; The ſumme whereof is but this. <hi>They hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſgrace preaching, and will not ſuffer men to preach or Catechiſe as they deſire.</hi> For anſwer to this, I ſay firſt; That it is a certaine truth (and granted by all that underſtand any thing in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) That the knowledge of God, and of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſalvation, is moſt neceſſary for every Chriſtian; ſo as without a competent meaſure thereof <hi>by ſome meanes</hi> attained, it is impoſſible for any man (come to yeares of diſcretion) to be ſaved. Secondly, It is alſo as certaine, that it is not in the power <hi>of nature</hi> to attaine unto this competencie of knowledge, in thoſe things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that concern the myſteries of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the helpe of a <hi>key</hi> reached out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from <hi>God himſelfe,</hi> who alone can make knowne what is that his <hi>good, acceptable,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Will,</hi> by beleeving and doing whereof, hee hath determined to bring men to happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is agreed upon by all <hi>Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> that this <hi>key of knowledge</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of God, contained in the <hi>Canonicall Scriptures</hi> of the old and new Teſtament, which containe all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now, it cannot but bee a moſt hatefull and odious ſinne and impiety, to take away from Chriſtians this <hi>Key of knowledge,</hi> and to barre them any way from the uſe of it; and this kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which was uſed by <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10652:91"/> the moſt cruell of all others, as tending not to the deſtroying of the bodies, but both of bodies and ſoules for ever in hell fire: and therfore we juſtly condemn the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as envious of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mens ſoules, in not permitting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be had, or read in a vulgar and known lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And if any of our <hi>Prelates</hi> ſhould doe the like, I think M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>B.</hi> might juſtly complain, and (in an orderly way) ſeek redreſſe of ſo great a miſchief. But this he cannot ſay: for, hee that hath ſaid ſo much, I doubt not (if he could have had the leaſt colour for it) but he would have ſaid that too. All the buſineſſe that he moves this ſtir about, is: <hi>The putting downe of ſome Lectures, and Sermons, and regulating of Catechiſing.</hi> And this he would have the people beleeve to bee the taking away of the key of knowledg, and the means of the knowledg of God, and of the myſteries of ſalvation. And this hath beene an old deceit, with which many Miniſters of his faction have coſened (if not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) the people. For, whatſoever is ſpoken concerning the efficacie, or neceſſity of <hi>Gods</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hook. Eccl. Pol. l.</hi> 5. §. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Word,</hi> the ſame they tie and reſtraine only unto <hi>Sermons;</hi> howbeit, not to <hi>Sermons read</hi> neither, (for ſuch they alſo abhor in the Church) but <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons without booke,</hi> Sermons which ſpend their life in their birth, and may have publike audience but once. And hence it is that theſe great cryes are raiſed, that a Miniſter ſhall not for any irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity be ſuſpended, or his extravagant fancies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or any order for the time, or manner of preaching preſcribed, but preſently they cry out,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10652:91"/> that the <hi>Word of God, the Goſpel, &amp; ordinary means of ſalvation are taken away, or hindered.</hi> The truth is we have no Word of God but the <hi>Scripture:</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike <hi>Sermons</hi> were, unto ſuch as heard them, <hi>his Word,</hi> even as properly, as unto us their <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> are. Howbeit not ſo our owne Sermons, the expoſitions which our diſcourſe of wit doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and miniſter out of the Word of God. And much leſſe every fond opinion, which paſſion, or miſguided zeale, ſhall utter out of the Pulpit. To dignifie <hi>theſe</hi> with the name of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> is both a groſſe <hi>taking of Gods Name in vaine,</hi> and a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>deluſion</hi> of Gods People. And yet ſo farre are ſome tranſported and carried away with this miſ-perſwaſion, that they attribute more to mens expoſitions, than to the pure and infallible Word of God it ſelfe. For they deny that any power to ſave ſoules, though read, or otherwiſe publiſhed in a knowne tongue, and ſo plainely expreſſed, that it cannot tranſcend the capacity of a meane underſtanding, as indeed it is (and we confidently, and upon ſure and infallible grounds mantaine it to be ſo againſt our adverſaries of <hi>Rome)</hi> in thoſe things that are abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation. Which opinion of theirs (if ever any were) is moſt ſenſeleſſe, and contrary to all reaſon. For wee read, that <hi>the Scriptures are able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> That the <hi>Word of God received</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21</note> 
                  <hi>with meeknes, &amp; ingrafted, is able to ſave our ſoules:</hi> and that they thus commended the Scriptures, as availeable to this end, for certaine, had no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceit which they never opened to any,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10652:92"/> a conceit that no man in the world ſhould be that way the better for any ſentence in it, till ſuch time as the ſame might chance to bee <hi>preached</hi> upon or alledged, at the leaſt, in a <hi>Sermon.</hi> There is no ſuch coherence between <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> that ordinarily a Chriſtian mans beleefe ſhould naturally grow from thence, and not poſſibly from any other kinde of notification of the Word of God. The Apoſtle indeed faith, that <hi>faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> But is not the Word as well heard when it is read, as when it is preached upon, in Maſter <hi>Burtons</hi> preciſe acception of the word. The begetting of faith in mens hearts, commeth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of two things. Firſt, the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is the object of faith. Secondly, the <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of this object to the underſtanding by ſuch meanes as it may bee able to apprehend it: and this <hi>notification</hi> or conveighing of the word of God to the underſtanding, is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls hearing, and comprehends in it both <hi>reading</hi> of it by a man's ſelfe, &amp; <hi>hearing</hi> it read by, others, or any other way whereby it may come to be <hi>underſtood</hi> and aſſented unto, as <hi>preaching</hi> (in that ſenſe to which it is, by theſe men, reſtrained by way of <hi>Sermons;)</hi> and yet we muſt give <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> (even in that ſenſe) it's due: and farre be it from any, yea and I dare confidently ſay, it is farre from any of thoſe whom Maſter <hi>B.</hi> taxeth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it it's juſt honor: onely let it not be lifted up to an unjuſt competition with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and immediately inſpired Word of God it ſelfe; and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10652:92"/> much leſſe preferred before it in power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie; or to have the word of God to borrow and fetch its power and ſaving vertue from it; neither let it not bee oppoſed to, or bring in contempt (that which it ought chiefely to labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote) the <hi>publicke prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the true and proper worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>With theſe <hi>Cautions,</hi> whatſoever honour men ſhall give (not to every vaine babling &amp; venting of fables &amp; newes, &amp; corantoes, out of the Pulpit, but) to <hi>preaching</hi> rightly ſo called, that is, the ſober and ſolid explication &amp; application of any portion of the word of God, will never offend the <hi>Prelates</hi> of theſe times, nor any other piouſly affected Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Let them dignifie this, if they pleaſe (in a ſecundary ſenſe) with the title of <hi>Gods word:</hi> Let them call the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of it even in reſpect of <hi>this</hi> (as the Apoſtle hath done in regard of their whole office) <hi>co-workers</hi> or <hi>joynt-labourers with God;</hi> (than which, what greater dignity can be imagined?) yet they ſhall not be gaine ſaid by any <hi>Prelate,</hi> or feare the cenſure of the <hi>High-commiſſion for it.</hi> Men doe not (we know) bring the ſaving knowledge of God into the world with them: it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled by ſome meanes, and among the reſt, it is Gods ordinance, <hi>That the Prieſts lips which ſhould</hi>

                  <hi>preſerve knowledge,</hi> ſhould in this way <hi>let their doctrine drop as the raine, and their ſpeech diſtill as the dew:</hi> and that the <hi>people</hi> (who have not the like opportunity or ability of knowledge) might <hi>ſeeke the law at their mouthes,</hi> who (even in this) <hi>are the meſſengers</hi> of the Lord of Hoſts. Yea, if
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10652:93"/> this bee not enough, let them <hi>preferre</hi> this above all other <hi>meanes,</hi> and it will eaſily be granted, in regard they are more apt to make impreſſion upon the hearers, more powerfull incentives of good affections, than other wayes of teaching are. But all this notwithſtanding, though there be ſo much of <hi>God</hi> in this work, yet there is ſomewhat of <hi>man</hi> ſtill in the beſt of them, and that, where ever it be, is not priviledged from error, <hi>imperfection</hi> and <hi>vanity:</hi> and hence it comes to paſſe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 31, 32.</note> times men (with thoſe in the prophet) uſe their tongues, and ſay; <hi>The Lord ſaith, when God ſent them not, nor commanded them, but they propheſie falſe dreames, and cauſe the people to erre by their lightneſſe:</hi> Yea too often (as theſe ſermons here before us,) men make the <hi>Pulpit</hi> but a ſtage to act their paſſionate diſtempers and ſpleene, to ranſack the affaires of ſtate, and to pick out thence ſuch things as may claw the peoples itch, who ever are content to heare thoſe above them taxed; or if men doe not ſhew themſelves to bee <hi>men</hi> in ſo groſſe a manner; yet it cannot bee expected, but that diſcretion will bee ſometimes wanting, to know what meate is fitteſt for the ſtrength of their auditory, and when and how to adminiſter that which is ſufficient for their due nouriſhment, without the over laying of their ſtomackes, to the ingendring of ſpirituall crudities, and corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.

Yea and our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelfe (whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not contradict) told his Diſciples of ſuch an <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> that he thought not fit to preach to his Diſciples the things which they ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be taught, when he ſaith, <hi>I have yet many</hi>

                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.</note> and a <hi>time</hi> for worke, a <hi>time</hi> alſo for recreation:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10652:94"/> and it is a point of <hi>wiſedome</hi> to fit every worke to its beſt <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> and the fitneſſe of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a great furtherance to the worke, which many times by unſeaſonablenes becomes unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and gaines contempt. It is, without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then beſt received, when mens minds are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from diſtraction of worldly cares or pleaſures: and therefore the <hi>Sundayes</hi> and <hi>Holidayes</hi> are the fitteſt times for Preaching, and not upon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-dayes,</hi> when men muſt be <hi>dilemm'd</hi> betweene the word of God, and their worldly affaires; and when ſome willingly, others ſometimes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to preferre their body and the world, before their ſoules and Heaven: and much leſſe (as if a ſermon were of kin to a fiddle or a bagpipe) to have preaching upon every merry meeting, or feaſting, or at a Beare-baiting (at which I once heard of a ſermon made) which cannot be but a prophanation of <hi>Gods Name,</hi> and derogation from the honour of his ordinance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the <hi>manner</hi> of it, it muſt bee done gravely, with religious reverence, for the edifying of men in their holy faith and godlines; not vainely, or with intermixture of Fables, newes, or paſſionate declamations; for ſuch <hi>prophane and vaine bablings will encreaſe unto</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>more ungodlineſſe, and their words will eat, as doth a Gangrene, edifying to nothing, but</hi> ſedition, and the ſubverſion of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the meaſure; That cannot bee <hi>rightly</hi> done, that is <hi>over-done,</hi> and there may be a <hi>too-much</hi> even in the beſt things; and ſpirituall
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10652:94"/> food, as well as corporall, muſt bee taken with reſpect to the digeſtive faculty of the eaters. The too-often, and over-much taking of the beſt and daintieſt fare, begets loathing and contempt, whereas the moderate uſe, procures appetite, helps digeſtion, and mantaines their due eſteeme: and certainly, there is nothing more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to piety, than to uphold the Majeſties of the Prieſtly, or miniſteriall offices, and among the reſt, of <hi>Preaching;</hi> which cannot but bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, if it be, either too often, or out of <hi>due meaſure</hi> obtruded upon men; for familiarity, we know, breeds contempt, but retiredneſſe is the preſerver of Majeſties, and rarity commends pleaſures, and makes them more delightfull, and (with moderation) muſt needs make preaching pretious, and become more acceptable, which, if it be not, it cannot profit: Beſides, Sermons muſt be ordered for their meaſure, and length, that they leave roome ſufficient for <hi>ſolemne Prayers,</hi> and other <hi>Divine Offices; theſe</hi> muſt not bee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall'd to lengthen <hi>them,</hi> nor vilified, by meanes of any <hi>new-deviſed</hi> formes of praier, either uſhering, or following them. And therefore, when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (to whom the care and charge of theſe things belong) ſhall in their wiſdomes thinke fit to uſe their juſt power, to order, and regulate Preachers and Sermons according to theſe rules, they doe no wrong, but right, to the Word of God, and what in duty they are bound to doe. If Lectures be unſeaſonable, or not in places fitting; if they be upheld with faction, abuſed, and made
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10652:95"/> nouriſhers of <hi>ſedition</hi> &amp; <hi>male-contented</hi> thoughts; or caſt contempt upon the Paſtorall charge, and ſetled miniſtery. To <hi>ſuppreſſe</hi> ſuch Lectures, and <hi>ſuſpend</hi> ſuch Preachers, is but juſt and fit: and others than ſuch as have beene guilty in theſe, or the like kindes, have not received any ſuch cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If <hi>Sermons</hi> upon the Lords day bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to that length, that they juſtle out the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Church, or be become of that eſteeme, as that men ſhrinke up all religion into hearing, or that they be of that ſtraine, that the ignorant may be <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth;</hi> it is but reaſon that they both cut them ſhorter, and provide for the due eſteem of other religious duties, and for the inſtruction of the ignorant, by turning <hi>Sermons</hi> into <hi>catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> and if that be abuſed too, and that men, in ſtead of <hi>laying the foundation, and teaching the firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> (which is the true catechizing) ſhall ſoare aloft, and adventure upon the moſt high and abſtruſe points in Divinity, and notwithſtanding his Majeſties Declaration to the contrary, ſhall deliver the doctrines of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> and that in ſuch wiſe, as to make God the <hi>author of ſinne</hi> and <hi>obduration</hi> in ſinne, which is blaſphemy in the higheſt degree: if men uſe to catechiſe after this manner (as ſome of late have done) is it not high time to reduce men to the preſcribed platforme of the <hi>Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme,</hi> which (even in the bare queſtions and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as it is there ſet forth) cannot bee denied (without extreame ignorance, or impudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10652:95"/> to containe the principles of <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and whatſoever is neceſſary to be known of thoſe for whom it was intended; for the fitting of them for the <hi>receiving of the Lords Supper.</hi> Laſtly, if Sermon-prayers ſhall bee uſed as libels, (as ſome have uſed them) or be exalted above the prayers of the Church (as with too many they are) it cannot but bee much better to tie men to the forme preſcribed in the <hi>Canon</hi> (which was the old uſe of theſe prayers in this Church) and to ſhut up all in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all contradiction, the moſt abſolute patterne of prayer, and the ſumme of all rightly-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved petitions.</p>
               <p>My concluſion then is, that the Reverend <hi>Biſhops,</hi> doing theſe things upon theſe grounds (and no otherwiſe, and upon other grounds they have done nothing in this kinde) are unjuſtly charged to take away the <hi>key of knowledge,</hi> whoſe right uſe by theſe meanes is preſerved and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſingular benefit of Chriſtian ſoules.</p>

               <p> My Anſwer to this ſhall bee very briefe, for that the ſame crimination is by Maſter <hi>B.</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his <hi>Lawleſſe Pamphlet</hi> intituled, <hi>An Anſwer to a late Treatiſe of the Sabbath day;</hi> and ſince by the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> of that Treatiſe (that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable maſſe of ſolid learning) the <hi>L.

Yet ſomewhat I will ſay, for their ſakes that have not that Booke at hand. Firſt, it is confeſt, that the <hi>holy Scripture is the ſole and compleat Rule of Faith.</hi> This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and ſubſcribed Doctrine of our Church: <note place="margin">Artic. 6.</note> And therefore it were ſtrange that <hi>they,</hi> who themſelves have ſo often ſubſcribed, and who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſubſcription from others, ſhould goe againſt ſo confeſſed a truth: and certainly, if hee had had but the leaſt graine of ingenuity, in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the writings of other men, or rather, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice had not wholly filled him with ignorance and confidence, hee would never have dream't of any contradiction to this Doctrine, in the words by him alledged, or to have ſtretched matters of Religion ſubjected to the <hi>Biſhops determination,</hi> to the <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> points of Faith, which no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> ever affirmed. But ſomewhat ſure there is in it, that is in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſubmitted to the <hi>Biſhops judgement:</hi> True; and ſo it ever was in the Church of God. But this extends not to matters of Faith, or manners to be believed, and done of neceſſitie to ſalvation, ſo as to coine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10652:97"/> new articles in either kinde: The power which by them is challenged, and by all underſtanding Chriſtians in all ages of the Church aſcribed to them, is no other but that which is given them by the tenth Article of our Religion, whoſe words are; <hi>That the Church hath power to decree rites, and ceremonies, and authoritie in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Preface to the Booke of Common-Prayer, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parties, doubting of any thing that is conteined in that Booke to the Biſhop, and the Biſhop doubting, to the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</note> 
                  <hi>of Religion.</hi> Where by the Church (whoever Maſter <hi>B.</hi> underſtands) is meant the <hi>heads,</hi> and <hi>Governors</hi> in the Church, to whom the right of direction and government doth peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and therefore they are called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or Overſeers, and Rulers, or Guides, and Leaders, as being, by their Office, to judge of things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to direct thoſe that are under their charge.</p>
               <p>Now this power of theirs hath theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. 1. It is not <hi>ſupreme,</hi> but <hi>miniſteriall,</hi> not ruling, but ruled by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which rule they are to ſquare their determinations in all matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> being altogether unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, to define any thing contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 2. The things wherein they have power to decree, ordaine, alter and change any thing touching Religion in the Church, is onely in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> which are in compariſon, of the points of <hi>Faith,</hi> onely circumſtantiall as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning time, place, geſture, order, and the like, to bee obſerved in the ſervice of God. 3. In theſe things which they thus order, and ordaine; they muſt keepe them to thoſe generall Rules. 1. That things be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e decently, and in order. 2. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10652:97"/> bee ordained contrary to the Scripture. 3. That things beſide the Scripture ordained, be not inforced to be believed of <hi>neceſſitie</hi> to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as our <hi>Article</hi> ſpeakes. 4. Their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in matters of Religion are not infallible, neither did they ever challenge, nor any (that ever I heard of among us) aſcribe unto them, no not to the <hi>Arch-prelate</hi> any <hi>Papall inſallibilitie of Spirit:</hi> Neither did they arrogate any other abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of right, and true judgement in things than is attained by ordinary meanes, nor any immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine Inſpiration, or Aſſiſtance annexed to their Chaire, all which the Pope doth. Laſtly, the <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> that is required by thoſe that are under them, Miniſters and people, is not <hi>abſolute,</hi> and ſuch as no inferiour <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can without ſinne diſſent from their judgements; but in regard of <hi>externall order,</hi> and for the avoiding of confuſion, and ſects in the Church; as it is not left free for every man to appoint, or judge of matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> or to have them after their owne way, ſo it cannot but be a <hi>great diſorder,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>ſinne,</hi> for any man out of his private humour openly to reclaime, or to diſobey thoſe who are inveſted with the power of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature. This being the power that is given, or challenged by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> it cannot but be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thinke that any man, ſhould bee ſo paſt all ſhame, as ſo odiouſly to clamour (upon this ground) againſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, and to deride, and ſcorne the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Cant.</hi> calling him <hi>the Oracle,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:10652:98"/> and one that hath a <hi>Papall infallibilitie of Spirit,</hi> and the like. But for a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to doe it, puts it beyond all wonder, and aſtoniſhment; eſpecially if wee conſider theſe two things. Firſt, (which is alſo obſerved by the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Ely)</hi> that <note place="margin">See the Booke of Ordination</note> at his Ordination he promiſed, yea, ſwore that hee would <hi>reverently obey the Biſhops, and with a glad minde, and will follow their godly admonitions, and ſubmit to their godly judgements.</hi> 2. That every <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath a power of directing thoſe that are under his charge in matters of Religion, and that the <hi>people</hi> ought to inquire the <hi>Law at their Mouthes,</hi> and to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to their <hi>judgements;</hi> which to take away from them, were to robbe them of a maine part of the Prieſtly function: and yet I ſuppoſe neither challengeth any <hi>Papall infallibilitie of Spirit,</hi> nor requireth any <hi>blind obedience,</hi> and therefore how he can charge theſe things upon the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for clayming the ſame power over the inferiour <hi>Clergie,</hi> and people; which <hi>himſelfe</hi> as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath over the people committed to him, is more than wonderfull. Well, but for all that, here is a ſtrange piece of <hi>Poperie,</hi> which hee addes, <hi>uttered by the Chiefeſt Prelate of England in the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>

                  <hi>If Proteſtants receive the number, names of the Authors, and integrity of the parts, of bookes, divine and Canonicall, as delivered by Tradition, as I ſay they doe: and if without tradition we cannot know ſuch divine bookes, he (The Popiſh Treatiſor) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it conſequent, that tradition is the ground of our faith.

               <p>And my firſt concluſion ſhal be, That the Kings <label type="milestone">

               <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtles who from Chriſt received both the Prieſtly, and Epiſcopall power in one, did divide the ſame, and made <hi>diſtinct</hi> orders and degrees of them in the <hi>Church:</hi> in which they appointed <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> all which wee finde mentioned by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and in the moſt <hi>ancient</hi> Writers, and records, that are extant in the Church.

               <p>For the further demonſtration hereof.

               <p>That the <hi>Epiſcopall juriſdiction,</hi> even as it is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conclu. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>truly Epiſcopall</hi> and <hi>meerely ſpirituall;</hi> though in it ſelfe, it be received only from God: yet in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much it is exerciſed in <hi>his</hi> Majeſties Dominions, and upon <hi>his</hi> ſubjects, by <hi>his</hi> Majeſties conſent, command and royall Protection, according to the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> confirmed by <hi>his</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nothing hinders but that thus-farre all <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> Authority and juriſdiction may bee truly ſaid to be <hi>annexed to the Crowne, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this onely is the <hi>intent</hi> of thoſe <hi>Statutes</hi> which annex the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction to the Crowne.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, it may truly bee affirmed, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> have their <hi>function, and juriſdiction</hi> for the ſubſtance of it, as it is <hi>meerely ſpirituall,</hi> and ſo properly Eccleſiaſticall, by <hi>Divine right,</hi> and only from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that it is derived by a continuall, and uninterrupted <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But if Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Biſhops affirme, that they have
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10652:104"/> power to exerciſe this their <hi>ſpirituall juriſdiction</hi> within His Majeſties Dominions, and over His Subjects, of <hi>themſelves,</hi> and without licence, and authoritie from His Majeſtie. Or that their <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities,</hi> their <hi>revenewes,</hi> their Dignities to bee <hi>Barons</hi> of the Parliament &amp;c. or the <hi>authority</hi> that they have, and uſe either to judge in <hi>Cauſes temporall,</hi> or to inflict <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them by <hi>Divine right,</hi> or otherwiſe than by the <hi>favour</hi> of his Majeſty and his predeceſſors, hee makes them as abſurdly ignorant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous as himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The other thing which I cannot let paſſe, is, that which he here cites out of the Ieſuites pamphlet intituled, <hi>A direction to be obſerved by</hi> N. N. &amp;c. wherein the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> it ſeemes, applauds the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of our Church, as comming on towards Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Rome, The temper and moderation of the Arch Biſhop, and ſome other learned prelates, and the allowance of ſome things in theſe dayes, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times were counted ſuperſtitious,</hi> as the names of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>altars, and the acknowledging the viſible beeing of the Proteſtant Church for many ages, to have beene in the Church of Rome, &amp;c.</hi> My pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not here to enter the liſts with the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> who (I doubt not) ere long will bee more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>anſwered,</hi> than I have either leiſure or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to doe. All that I ſhall ſay for the preſent is, Firſt, that Maſter <hi>B.</hi> is willing (it ſeemes) to take <hi>dirt</hi> from any <hi>Dunghill</hi> to caſt in the face of his <hi>Mother</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that though hee profeſſe ſuch mortall hate to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10652:104"/> laſt affinity with her (though many times but imaginary) makes him breake forth into ſtrange expreſſions of his abomination. Yet hee can bee content to joyne hands with the worſt of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (the Ieſuites) and uſe their aide to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and make odious the <hi>Church</hi> in which hee was bred. But it is no <hi>Innovation,</hi> this; it hath beene a long practiſe of the <hi>Faction,</hi> (whereof he is now ambitious to become a <hi>captaine)</hi> both to joyne with them in their <hi>principles,</hi> and to make uſe of their weapons to fight againſt the Church wherein they live. Secondly, It is manifeſt from hence, that the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> and <hi>he,</hi> are confederates in detraction and ignorance of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our Church, which both of them judge of, not by the <hi>authoriſed Doctrine</hi> publikely ſubſcribed, or the <hi>regular ſteps</hi> of thoſe that have continued in the uſe of her ancient and laudable cuſtomes, rites and ceremonies: but by their owne humours and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine reports of ſome factiouſly-minded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It being uſuall with ſuch men of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to miſtake the religion profeſſed on either ſide: and as Maſter <hi>B.</hi> condemnes all that of <hi>Popery</hi> and ſuperſtition, that is <hi>croſſe</hi> to his fancied crotchets, though it be the doctrine that hath been ever taught in the Church of Chriſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch as himſelfe hath ſubſcribed; So the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> on the other ſide uſe to charge our Church with all thoſe <hi>tenets</hi> which they finde to bee by any among us, without reſpect had either to the conſent they have with the publickly received doctrine, or to the judiciall approbation that ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10652:105"/> opinions (which we many times deteſt as much, if not more than they) have from any <hi>authoriſed act</hi> of the Church; otherwiſe both the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> and <hi>hee</hi> might have knowne that many (for ſome of them are but meere <hi>fictions</hi> and ſlanders) of the things they accuſe of novelty, have beene ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the doctrine of this Church. For who knowes not that the names of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> are no ſuch ſtrangers in our Church, that any man ſhould bee fearefull of uſing them? ſuch as have ſtaggered at them, have beene juſtly counted more nice than wiſe: Eſpecially the name of <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which both our booke of <hi>Common-prayer</hi> and of <hi>Ordination</hi> have ever uſed, and kept on foot, though it ſounded but harſhly to ſome eares. And for that which the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> cals <hi>fiery Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> if he meane the <hi>Geneva diſcipline</hi> founded by him or any <hi>ſingular opinions</hi> which hee holds, wherein there hath appeared more <hi>heate</hi> than <hi>truth;</hi> I confeſſe it hath beene and is (the more is the pitty) the <hi>Darling</hi> of many in <hi>England,</hi> but without either <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>countenance</hi> from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: The Church of <hi>England</hi> in reforming of <hi>Romiſh</hi> errors tooke no patterne from <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor followed any private mans oppinion: and her wiſeſt and moſt judicious ſons, as they honour the learning and good parts of any, and of Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> among (yea and in ſome things haply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) others, ſo they have ever on the other ſide thought it an injury to receive their <hi>denomination</hi> from any <hi>doctrine,</hi> but that which is publickly taught and avowed by our owne Church: and all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10652:105"/> the <hi>innovation</hi> that may ſeeme to bee in them, is only, that (by the negligence of ſome that have beene in place, or rather, from their inability, than to foreſee the miſchiefe that now ſince appeares) contrary <hi>tenets</hi> and practices have growne ſo into ſuch faſhion, that the Churches true <hi>tenets</hi> and <hi>rites</hi> being revived, ſeeme no leſſe <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>new,</hi> than the old Engliſh <hi>habits</hi> would be judged among our preſent <hi>Courtiers.</hi> Or perhaps, (which I know not why any man ſhould be aſhamed of) that learning and induſtry being increaſed, and the heat of contention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, men begin to judge of opinions, not by the <hi>authors,</hi> but by the <hi>truth,</hi> and ſo ſome things, which by ſome have beene blaſted, for <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> and by others, taken up upon their credit to be ſuch, by <hi>judicious triall,</hi> are found conſonant to the truth of Chriſtian religion, and our Churches doctrine. Neither can any (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bewraying, either malice, or groſſe ignorance) call this a <hi>warping toward Popery,</hi> or that <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſme among us waxeth wearie of it ſelfe,</hi> when the doctrine and profeſſion (in all this ſeeming variation) remaines ſtill the ſame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered.</p>

                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:10652:109"/> that I have already ſhewed to bee untrue.

And thus hee hath dealt with this, for who knowes not, that Cathedrals have ever had certaine <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies, veſtments, and other ornaments,</hi> which have not beene uſed in <hi>Parochials?</hi> And that to reduce all <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches to their modell, is neither neceſſary nor convenient, nor almoſt poſſible to be done.

And therefore

                  <hi>before</hi> the <hi>people.</hi> But he proceeds (after his raving manner) to let fly at the <hi>uſages</hi> and <hi>ornaments</hi> in ſeverall <hi>Cathedralls;</hi> where it muſt be taken for an innovation, if any ornaments that were decayed have happened to bee renewed or <hi>repaired,</hi> or things neglected have beene <hi>reſtored;</hi>

               <p>At laſt he falles upon the <hi>Royall Chappell,</hi> which he ſaith, is the <hi>Innovators laſt refuge,</hi> and they (as <note place="margin">pag. 165.</note> hee falſely chargeth them) <hi>plead the whole equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page thereof, as a patterne for all Churches to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>

                  <hi>the Kings Chappell, as Quire of Gentlemen, &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had or maintained in ordinary Churches.</hi> But though theſe anſwers had beene ſufficient to have anſwered that argument, if it had been brought by any in that manner wherein he propounds it, yet hee reſts not in them, but addes others, and not obſcurely intimates, that the practice even of the <hi>Royall Chappell,</hi> and the <hi>rites</hi> there uſed, are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the Law of the Land, and the <hi>Divine rule</hi> of Scripture, and compares the uſe of them, to the <hi>bowing to King</hi> Nebuchadnezzars <hi>golden Image, and the offering of incenſe in the preſence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> Iulian <hi>the Apoſtatels Altar, at his command; which the godly ſervants of God in thoſe times by no meanes could be brought to doe.</hi> And concludes with a ſuppoſall, <hi>That if Maſſe were ſet up in the Kings Chappell, it were no good argument, why it ſhould be admitted in all the Churches throughout the Realme of England.</hi> And I verily beleeve that the argument is <hi>inſufficient</hi> to make the Maſſe, or any other idolatrous worſhip to bee lawfull. But ſay with all, that his anſwers are <hi>dangerous</hi> and moſt <hi>diſloyall inſinuations</hi> of the violation of Law, of Idolatry and ſuperſtition practiſed in the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chappell,</hi> by the allowance, and in the preſence of His moſt <hi>Sacred Majeſty;</hi> and fitter for the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Authority</hi> than other anſwer. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (as hee doth) with that, which if hee had
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10652:111"/> rightly conſidered, would have taught him more <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>loyalty,</hi> and have ſaved me this <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: My ſonne feare thou the Lord, and the King: and medle not with them that are given to change: for their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ruine of them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have gone over theſe <hi>eight</hi> heads of <hi>Innovations,</hi> wherein I was willing to follow Maſter <hi>Burtons</hi> method, and take his owne divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not that I thought it perfect (for I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have reduced them to halfe that number) but, becauſe I thought that the beſt way for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome kind of readers, who would (perhaps) if I had abridged their number, have thought ſome of them unanſwered.

               </argument>
               <p>IT was one of the greateſt evils that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to this Church, that in the infancy of the reformation (which was happily begun in the reigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> of happy memory) many for conſcience ſake and to avoyd the ſtorm of perſecution which fell in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> betaking themſelves to the reformed Churches abroad, and eſpecially to <hi>Geneva,</hi> were drawn into ſuch a liking of the forme of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline then newly erected by Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> there, that returning home, they became quite out of love with that which they found here eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Authority: inſomuch, that ſet on by the perſwaſions and examples of <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> and other fiery ſpirited Zealots in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they attempted and by all meanes endeavoured to advance their ſtrongly-fancied platforme of <hi>Genevian</hi> diſcipline.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10652:112"/> For the bringing about whereof, the courſe they then tooke for the drawing of the people to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their intentions, was, to pick quarels againſt the names, and titles given to the Fathers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of our Church, apparrell of Miniſters, and ſome ceremonies in the booke of Common prayer retained and preſcribed, which they taxed of ſuperſtition, and remnants of Popery. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when <hi>T. C.</hi> and others (who had alſo beene at <hi>Geneva)</hi> had drunke in the opinion of Maſter <hi>Beza,</hi> who by that time, had promoted the diſcipline there invented by his Maſter, and made it one of the eſpeciall notes of the true Church, as if it had till then beene maymed and imperfect: what bookes were then written, what ſeeming humble motions made, what pamphlets, paſquils, libels, flew abroad; yea, what violent attempts, plots, conſpiracies, and traiterous practices were then ſet on foot, by the men of that <hi>faction,</hi> are at large ſet forth in divers books of that argument, and are yet freſh in the memories of many alive at this day.</p>
               <p>What the care and couragious zeale of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venors of this Church and State then was, for the preventing and overthrowing of theſe mens deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſignes, the flouriſhing and peacefull eſtate which this Church hath ſince by their meanes enjoyed, doth abundantly ſpeake. For the authors of theſe <hi>innovations,</hi> troubles and diſorders, receiving juſt and publick cenſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall demerits; they which remained well-willers and abettors of that cauſe,

               <p>Being thus fruſtrate of their hopes of bringing in their darling plat-forme, ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

               <p>The <hi>ordination</hi> of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in our Church (as ever in the Church of Chriſt) belongs to the Biſhops, which (becauſe they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chooſe they are contented to accept from their hands, that their ſeale may protect them from danger of Law: but yet think themſelves
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10652:114"/> not rightly called to that Function, unleſſe they have withall gotten the approbation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and of the godly Miniſters: and for this end they muſt give triall of their gifts in ſome private conventicle, or adventure up at ſome Lecture (without the Churches ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) where ſome of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their <hi>Order</hi> ſhall be preſent, and after with the people at a Feaſt, pronounce ſentence of their <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>abilities.</hi> Which if it happen for them, they doubt not but they are <hi>rightly called.</hi> In like manner, for their calling to a <hi>Benefice</hi> or <hi>Paſtorall charge,</hi> taking the Patrons preſentation and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ordination only for their ſafe ſtanding and ſecurity of enjoying it, they muſt be <hi>called</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> too, the cure of whoſe ſoules they undertake.

So that upon the point, we may ſay of them as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> once of his <hi>Donatiſts: They have ordained Biſhop againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſcopum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Epiſcopum ordinaverunt, altare contra altare erexerunt</hi> Auguſt. <hi>Epist.</hi> 171.</note> or rather (becauſe they like that name bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) a private <hi>Presbytery,</hi> againſt the Biſhops; yea, and they have (though that name offend them too) <hi>erected Altar againſt Altar,</hi> ſetting up a <hi>new</hi> religion, a new faith, and forme of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay their faith is new, being (as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) <hi>a firme perſwaſion of Gods ſpeciall love to them in Chriſt, or an aſſurance of their election,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>ſalvation:</hi> which is nothing elſe, but to have a <hi>good conceit</hi> of a mans ſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods favor, to beleeve themſelves to bee his dearlings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>new</hi> in the <hi>inſtrument all cauſe</hi> of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not wrought by the word of God, as it is left written for our learning, by the <hi>holy men of God moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (that hath no power to worke converſion, but) <hi>preached,</hi> that is, (not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies out of the pulpit, a tables end will ſerve) expounded and applyed (as they call it) by them: with this helpe the word of God (otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient) becomes able to worke their <hi>converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and ſalvation; and (which is more ſtrange) to doe it in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> (for they admit no <hi>preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> acts to proceed) and that ſo <hi>powerfully,</hi> that it is impoſſible to <hi>reſist</hi> or to deferre the worke of it for a <hi>moment;</hi> and ſo <hi>ſenſibly,</hi> that every man may,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10652:115"/> yea and (if hee be rightly) muſt <hi>know</hi> the time of his <hi>converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>new</hi> in the <hi>effects</hi> of it; For firſt, it frees a man from the feare of him <hi>that is able to caſt body</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſoule into hell fire,</hi> ſo that they are exempted from that precept given by our Saviour comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us to feare him. They looke at Hell as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger paſt, and at Heaven, as if they were in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it already; holding the hope of reward a poore incentive to performe duty or endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, a reprobate may goe ſo farre as to abſtaine from evill and doe good, for feare of hell, and with an eye to the recompence of reward; ſo that a man muſt goe farther than this, or otherwiſe he can have no <hi>aſſurance</hi> that he is the childe of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it gives them a right, not to heaven onely, but even to the things of this life, which, if others (that want this faith) chance to have, they are in Gods ſight <hi>uſurpers,</hi> and ſhall as theeves and robbers be arraigned for them, at the dreadfull barre of Gods ſevere judgement ſeat, and bee condemned (not for the abuſe, but) for the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of whatſoever creatures of God, they have had any part in their whole lives, inſomuch as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bit of bread they eat, ſhall helpe to increaſe their ſcore and aggravate their condemnation. Whereas they (having by vertue of their faith) this <hi>right</hi> and faculty granted them, may uſe them ſecurely, and without all feare, I had almoſt ſaid, and <hi>abuſe</hi> them too, but I ſpare them; yet ſurely I have knowne ſtrange effects of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10652:116"/> and what conſequences naturally doe flow from it, I leave to the judicious and indifferent conſideration of any underſtanding man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it produces a ſtrange kind of <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> whereby at once, all their ſinnes <hi>paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>

Yea, ſo farre have ſome gone in oppoſition to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good workes, that they bluſh not to teach, that <hi>impenitencie</hi> it ſelfe doth not exclude from <hi>grace</hi> or ſalvation, for they ſay, that <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie is but a ſinne, and the impenitent but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and ſo the proper object of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> inaſmuch as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners:</hi> ſo ignorantly, and againſt the maine grounds of Chriſtian faith and piety, doe they wreſt that moſt ſweet and comfortable place to ſerve their owne fancies. So for good workes, though all agree to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10652:116"/> exclude them from being any meanes of not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>juſtification,</hi> but of <hi>ſalvation:</hi> yet ſome do admit them as it were ſpectators and witneſſes of the worke done, and in that reſpect require their <hi>preſence</hi> as neceſſary, though they contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the worke. But others are of a more <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime ſtraine,</hi> and they think them no way <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but rather <hi>hinderers</hi> of ſalvation: and whereas vulgar Chriſtians and the under-forme or ranke of <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> doe make uſe of them as ſignes and evidences of their faith and juſtification, theſe teach (as the moſt new and more refined way) that men ſhould try their <hi>workes</hi> by their <hi>faith,</hi> and that this is the onely way to have <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>untottering comfort,</hi> which the commiſſion of no ſinne can ecclypſe or diminiſh: for they beleeving, that God loves &amp; hath accepted their <hi>perſons,</hi> and that once for all, muſt beleeve alſo, that hee will take them altogether, with all faults, that they are or ſhall bee gulty of: and being his <hi>favorits,</hi> they may be aſſured that he will give them more liberty, and winke at more and grocer faults in them, than in unbeleevers and <hi>reprobates,</hi> who may haply be condemned to hell fire, for but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon a woman to luſt after her, when theſe ſcape with actuall adultery, and many other groſſe and grievous ſins lived &amp; dyed in without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; thoſe being but <hi>infirmities</hi> in them, which in others are <hi>ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>crying ſinnes.</hi> In which regard, they enjoy two notable priviledges. Firſt, that whereas to others, death, to them, life is the wages of ſinne; for they ſo farre extend
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:10652:117"/> that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſinne and all, which, together with all things elſe, <hi>workes together for their good and ſalvation.</hi> Secondly, they are by this means exempted from all <hi>puniſhment,</hi> as well in this world, as in the next, that all the <hi>afflictions</hi> which befall them, and death it ſelfe, are not <hi>puniſhments</hi> for their ſins, or ſignes of his diſpleaſure againſt them, (whom hee once and ever loved ſo dearely) but onely <hi>fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> and exerciſes of their graces.</p>
               <p>As their <hi>faith</hi> is new, ſo are many <hi>acts</hi> of Gods worſhip <hi>new</hi> too; Ile begin with the principall of them all, their <hi>Prayers:</hi> which are farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Prayers of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: for firſt, our Church appointeth <hi>publick Prayers,</hi> after a <hi>ſet and ſolemne</hi> forme; <hi>Prayers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ancient Church of Chriſt, and venerable for their antiquity; <hi>Prayers,</hi> wherein the meaneſt in the Congregation, by reaſon of the continuall uſe, may joyne in, and helpe to ſet upon God with an <hi>armie of Prayers: Prayers</hi> compoſed with that gravity, with ſuch pious, and ſoule-raviſhing ſtraines, with thoſe full, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull expreſſions of heavenly affection, that I ſuppoſe the world, ſetting them aſide, hath not the like volumne of <hi>holy Oriſons.</hi> But theſe are by them ſlighted and vilified, in whoſe mouthes the ſhort and pithy prayers of the Church are but <hi>ſhreads and pieces,</hi> and not worthy the name of <hi>Prayers,</hi> and the <hi>Letany</hi> accounted <hi>conjuring.</hi> And in ſtead of theſe <hi>regular devotions,</hi> they have brought in a <hi>long prayer,</hi> freſhly-conceived, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10652:117"/> brought forth by the Miniſter, and that, (God knowes) many times in bald and homely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſuch as wiſe men would bee aſhamed to tell a tale in, even to their equals, with many gaſping, and unſeemely <hi>pauſes,</hi> and multitudes of irkſome <hi>Tautologies,</hi> and (which is none of the leaſt defects of it) in which none of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is able to joyne with him or to follow him, as not knowing, no, nor the ſpeaker himſelfe ſometimes, what he is about to ſay.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> certaine places to be houſes of <hi>publick prayer,</hi> which places ſo conſecrated and appropriated to that holy Service, they judge fit that publick prayer be there made, as in the places where God is in a more ſpeciall manner <hi>preſent:</hi> but theſe places are by them contemned, and every place, a <hi>parlour, barne,</hi> or <hi>play-houſe,</hi> accounted as <hi>holy</hi> and fit as they, for publick prayer or any other act of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>prayers</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have ever been conceived, not only as duties to bee performed, but as meanes alſo, ſanctified by God for the obtayning of his bleſſings, whereby he is moved to grant our deſires: but with them they are accounted only <hi>duties</hi> which muſt bee done, in doing whereof men do not ſo much move God, or diſpoſe him to grant their deſires, as themſelves to receive them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when we (according as our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath taught us in that holy <hi>pattern</hi> of prayer which he left with his Diſciples) do pray that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:10652:118"/> God would <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> wee meane ſimply and unfeignedly to obtayn fogiveneſſe, and that by this meanes; but they, praying for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes, intend only <hi>continuation</hi> of that grace of remiſſion of ſinnes, which they have already received, which grace, being immutable, prayer for that purpoſe is by them judged alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuperfluous: the mayne end therefore that they ayme at in their prayers, is, that they may grow more and more in <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the remiſſion of their ſinnes. If we paſſe from prayer to the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which, as our Church teaches, are <hi>morall inſtruments</hi> to conveigh thoſe graces unto the receivers, which the <hi>outward ſignes</hi> viſibly repreſent; and ſo, that in Baptiſme infants receive <hi>remiſsion</hi> of their ſinnes, and are <hi>truly regenerate:</hi> Theſe men will allow the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> no ſuch vertue, accounting them as <hi>bare ſignes</hi> and <hi>ſeales</hi> of that grace which they have already received, if they be elect; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they hold them to be but as <hi>ſeales ſet to a blank,</hi> being to no pupoſe, and of no value; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no ſuch <hi>tie</hi> between the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that what the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhall do vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, <hi>God</hi> ſhould bee thought, at the ſame time, and by that meanes, to effect inwardly by his grace and holy ſpirit. And therefore when (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our forme of Miniſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) they are to ſay, that the child baptized is regenerate, ſome of them are faine to interlace <hi>[we hope]</hi> and think it true, only in the <hi>judgement of charity,</hi> or in caſe they bee <hi>elected;</hi> in which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10652:118"/> caſe <hi>ſome</hi> think (though others ſtrongly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict) they may bee ſaid truly to bee <hi>regenerate</hi> in Baptiſme. Of the ſame ſtraine is their doctrine of the bleſſed <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> wherein they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no power of <hi>conſecration</hi> in the Prieſt; no other <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt than by way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; no other <hi>exhibition</hi> than by way of <hi>ſignation</hi> or <hi>obſignation;</hi> nor other <hi>grace</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed, but in <hi>ſeeming</hi> or (at beſt) the only the <hi>aſſuring</hi> of what they had before; which (if they have not) they muſt want, for all that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> can do. Thus have they made theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordinances of God, of <hi>none effect through their traditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I cannot omit (though I have already touched it in part) which is, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obſerving of <hi>Faſts,</hi> and the courſe they have deviſed how to have them their <hi>owne way.</hi> The piety of the Church of Chriſt, in whoſe ſteps the Church of <hi>England</hi> treads, as they have their appointed ſolemne <hi>Feſtivals</hi> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Gods ſpeciall mercies by publick thankſgivings and rejoycings; ſo they have alſo appointed ſet times for <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> as the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> the foure <hi>Embers,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe (though the work of faſting ſeem to pleaſe them) <hi>they</hi> reject and ſcorn; firſt, for that they are <hi>ſet-times,</hi> and perhaps becauſe appointed by <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> for they would, by their good-wils, have them only <hi>occaſionall,</hi> and in the time of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary calamities, either felt or feared, and to be appointed by the <hi>Miniſter</hi> when he ſhall judge
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10652:119"/> the neceſſities of Chriſtians ſo to require. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing they diſlike them for, is; That they are <hi>not enjoyned to be kept as Sabbaths extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> (which is their doctrine) and ſo to have the <hi>duties of the Sabbaths,</hi> then obſerved after an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner;</hi> as namely <hi>abſtinence</hi> from bodily labour, and the works of mens particular Callings, and two or more <hi>Sermons</hi> of a more than ordinary ſize, of which I have already ſpoken ſomewhat. Now becauſe the diligence and care of the Church and State, and the watchfulnes of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuivants,</hi> hath frighted them from their private aſſemblies, where they were wont, to enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their owne way in this kind. They have uſed in the City of London, a new, and a quaint ſtratagem, whereby, without ſuſpicion, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their deſires. The courſe they take is this: Some good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (that is, <hi>Profeſſors)</hi> intimate their neceſſities to ſome <hi>Miniſter</hi> of note among them, and obteine of them the promiſe of their paines to preach upon that occaſion, pitching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch dayes and places, as where and when Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Lectures are wont to bee; and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>under-hand</hi> notice to ſuch as they judge <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> of the day to bee obſerved, and the places where they ſhall meet for that end, thither they reſort, and mixing themſelves with the crowd, unſuſpected have the <hi>word</hi> they ſo much deſire, with the <hi>occaſion covertly glanced at,</hi> ſo as thoſe that are not of <hi>their counſell,</hi> are never the wiſer. Thus I have divers times known them to begin the day upon a <hi>wedneſday,</hi> where they had a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10652:119"/> beginning at ſix in the morning, and holding them till after eight: that being done, they poſt (ſomtimes in troopes) to another Church, where the Sermon beginning at nine, holds them till paſt eleven, &amp; from thence againe, they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a third Church, and there place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the afternoone Sermon begin, which holds them till night. And ſo (without danger of the <hi>Purſuivants,</hi> they obſerve a <hi>Publick Faſt,</hi> as much as theſe <hi>hard times</hi> will give them leave) after their owne way and heart.</p>
               <p>I ſhould tyre my reader if I ſhould at large ſet downe their ſeverall <hi>tenets</hi> and <hi>poſitions:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are beſides others, againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Doctrine of the ancient and of our mother Church of England. Among which are the Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for which of late they have raiſed ſuch lowd cryes, as if, without it bee eſtabliſhed among us, <hi>the glory were departed from Iſrael and the Arke of God taken.</hi> Of the ſame ſtraine are their opinions concerning <hi>contracts</hi> and their neceſſity: which they uſe to ſolemnize in private houſes, with a <hi>Sermon and feaſting</hi> (two uſuall companions) I will not ſay, to affront and baffle the orders, and received cuſtomes of our Church (I thinke that beyond the intention of many among them) though the event proclaime that to be the attendant of their opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. To theſe I might adde many more, as their aſſertion of the <hi>impoſſibility of the obſervation of the Law of God,</hi> not to the meere <hi>naturall man,</hi> but even to the <hi>regenerate,</hi> and aſſiſted by the <hi>grace</hi> of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10652:120"/> God: a point of dangerous conſequence, both in regard of that rub which it caſts before Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in their way to heaven, and of the advantage which thereby the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> have taken, to caſt a ſcandall upon our Church: as if, what theſe have in conſiderately broached, were a part of <hi>her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> So likewiſe their <hi>traditions</hi> about <hi>callings,</hi> with their many conceits about <hi>them,</hi> obtruded upon many credulous and tender conſciences, by which, they are many times needleſly affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tormented, while their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> by tying and untying of theſe knots of their owne knitting, doe gaine the people, and <hi>ſuck</hi> from them no <hi>ſmall advantage.</hi> But I paſſe over theſe and many others, as their innumerable <hi>ſignes and markes of Grace,</hi> invented many of them to <hi>ſecond</hi> that good opinion of themſelves, which by their <hi>faith</hi> at firſt they entertained. I paſſe alſo their <hi>rites, ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>uſages,</hi> ſuperſtitiouſly obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: in all, or moſt of which, any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man may obſerve an affectation of ſingularity, and oppoſition to the Church, whereof they would ſeeme members: omitting then all theſe, I wil only adde ſomthing of their <hi>courſes</hi> of late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the propagation of their <hi>new Church</hi> and Goſpel; amongſt which the moſt dangerous and cunning that ever they hatched was that of the <hi>buying in of impropriations:</hi> a pious &amp; a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke, and ſuch as rightly intended, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed by all thoſe that ſincerely affect the good of this Church and Religion. This project ſo ſpecious in ſhew, had for a long while a faire
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10652:120"/> paſſage, and the approbation of many more than of their owne ſtraine, till at length their purpoſes were unvailed, and their aime diſcovered; which was, the erecting of a <hi>ſeminary</hi> at Saint <hi>Antholins,</hi> ſubordinated to a <hi>Claſsis</hi> or <hi>Clerolaicall Conſiſtory,</hi> who had power (at leaſt in their intentions) to plant there ſuch hopefull imps, as ſhould bee fit, upon the falling of any of their purchaſed <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,</hi> to be removed &amp; tranſplanted into great &amp; populous places in this Kingdom, in which they endeavoured ſo to faſten and fence theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>choice ones,</hi> that no Eccleſiaſticall <hi>cenſure</hi> ſhould touch or deprive them of their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: by that meanes, hoping in ſuch places, (to uſe the words of a prime agent in that cauſe) to eſtabliſh the <hi>Goſpel by a perpetuall decree</hi> to this end alſo, they had ſundry attempts, of which theſe <hi>two</hi> were <hi>famous.</hi> Firſt, the ſtriving by <hi>money,</hi> to purchaſe the place of an <hi>Head</hi> of an houſe in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> for one of their owne party, for the firſt trayning up of their novices in their miſteries. And the other was in (the like way) their attempt for the getting of a <hi>Commiſſaries</hi> place, there where they intended to make a <hi>ſpeciall plantation,</hi> who being after their own hearts, might winke at their irregularities, and ſecure them from the danger of that Court. The ſcanning of which and other their attempts, I leave to the indifferent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent. In the meane time, I ſhall ever bleſſe God that put it into the heart of His ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the State, timely to diſcover and prevent this their purpoſe before it had undermined the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10652:121"/> preſent government of the Church, as no queſtion it would have given a good ſay to it, if it had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controule proceeded as it began. And for this, that learned and famous man in his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Maſter <hi>William Noy,</hi> (at that time His Majeſties <hi>Attorney</hi> generall) deſerves an honorable memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among thoſe that are true well-willers to the Church and State; whoſe induſtrie and zealous paines, in this cauſe, was a chiefe meanes of it's diſcovery and overthrow. And that the rather, becauſe for that one peece of ſervice ſake, he fell <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> from the grace and favour of that <hi>faction;</hi> and Maſter <hi>B.</hi> or the Author, who ever he was, of that <hi>libell</hi> annexed to his <hi>Divine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> (as if he were ſome fury, whoſe hate death could not pacifie) for that and his ſervice againſt <hi>Prynne,</hi> tramples upon his memory, and piſſes (as it were) upon the aſhes of him, and his unfortunate eldeſt ſonne, whom he reſerves for the laſt ſcene of that his late audaciouſly vented fable, as if hee had beene the moſt remarkable prodigie of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, by him brought upon the State. But I leave him, &amp; his preſumptuous cenſurers to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which, (whatſoever theirs be) I am ſure, is <hi>according unto truth:</hi> Neither will it boote <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2.</note> them, that (which they now ſo much boaſt of) their <hi>perſons are accepted,</hi> for <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God in the day wherein hee ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I finde my ſelfe digreſſed: to returne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and to conclude that which I intended by this briefe relation of the Doctrine and practices
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10652:121"/> of theſe men, it may manifeſtly appeare, who they are that may rightly bee termed <hi>Innovators</hi> and broachers of <hi>novell opinions,</hi> and <hi>practiſes</hi> in this Church; and how eaſie it were, by way of <hi>recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> to cry quittance with Maſter <hi>B.</hi> and for his <hi>eight,</hi> to charge him and his party, with five times that number, not ſuch as his <hi>(fond ſurmiſes</hi> ignorantly, and falſely accuſed of novelty and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition) but <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> ſuch, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canon, nor Article of the Church for them, nor any ſolid foundation in the Word of God, and which are (ſome of them at leaſt) as dangerous to the ſoules of men, and as great enemies to the power of godlineſſe, as any of thoſe which hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for ſuch as are by him pretended to be. If any man complaine of brevity, or of confuſion, and want of order in the relation; let him know, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, rather for <hi>a taſte,</hi> and to ſhew what might be done in that way, than for any full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which would have required more than my preſent leiſure, and have ſwoln my booke too much beyond its intended proportion. If they judge it <hi>defective,</hi> as wanting proofe, and becauſe I have not produced the Authors of thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I mention; I anſwer to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that it did not ſtand with my preſent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was only to point out the things in a curſory way, in which I conceive, the producing of proofes and Authors might well be ſpared. But for further anſwer I ſay, that I did it for two other reaſons: Firſt, becauſe the things are ſo well knowne, yea, and acknowledged by thoſe from
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10652:122"/> whom (if from any) contradiction was to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I could not thinke it neceſſary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe I could not doe it, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome mens names and writings upon the Stage, which if I had done, Maſter <hi>B.</hi> in his next treatiſe, would have ſtiled me as bad as hee hath done my betters; but that did not ſo much diſwade me, as the reſpect I beare to many of their <hi>perſons,</hi> from whom, though, for the truths ſake, I muſt teſtifie my diſſent, yet I ſhall never by Gods grace expreſſe any diſaffection to their perſons, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them any blame or blemiſh; ſo long as they (as I verily beleeve many of them heartily doe) remain ſtudious of true piety, and of the <hi>Churches peace.</hi> What I have written in this kinde, (God himſelfe knowes whom I have ſerved in it) I have written out of love to truth and peace, and of them who are miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>led by theſe errors: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay to them (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concluding an Epiſtle of his to ſome of <hi>Donatus</hi> partly) <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Erit autem vobis bic ſermo, quem de munere Dei novit ipse, quanta &amp; pacis, &amp; vestra dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione de promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, correctio ſi velitis, teſtis verò et ſi nolitis</hi> Auguſt. Epiſt. 162. <hi>in fine.</hi>
